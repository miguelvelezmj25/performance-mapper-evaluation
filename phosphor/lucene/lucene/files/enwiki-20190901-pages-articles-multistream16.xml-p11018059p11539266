(Part of the [[Memorial Route of Jewish Martyrdom and Struggle in Warsaw]])]]

'''Paweł Frenkiel''' (sometimes also '''Frenkel''', {{lang-he|פאוול פרנקל}};
1920–1943) was a Polish Army officer and a [[Jew]]ish youth leader in Warsaw and one of the senior commanders of the [[Jewish Military Union]], or the ŻZW. Although one of the most important leaders of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and the Jewish resistance in the months preceding April 1943, Frenkiel is also one of the least well known to historians, and both his earlier life and his ultimate fate are a subject of some controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SiM&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Various authors |editor=[[Dariusz Libionka]] |year=2007 |title=Rozmowa z Józefem Grynblattem, członkiem Betaru i Żydowskiego Związku Wojskowego w czasie powstania w getcie warszawskim |journal=Zagłada Żydów.

==Biography==
Paweł Frenkiel was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. At the age of 18 he joined the revisionist [[Zionism|Zionist]] youth movement [[Betar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PWN&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Wielka Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN|Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN]] |title=Żydowski Związek Wojskowy |url= |edition= |year=2005 |publisher=[[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]] |volume= |location=Warsaw |id= |pages= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[September Campaign|German conquest of Poland]] and the start of German repressions against the Jewish population of Poland, he joined the Jewish Military Union and became one of its highest-ranking members. It is unclear what his exact capacity was.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apfelbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Marian Apfelbaum |editor= |others= |title=Two Flags: Return to the Warsaw Ghetto |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2007 |publisher=Gefen Publishing House |location= |isbn=9789652293565 |oclc= |pages=56, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier publications and accounts by Tadeusz Bednarczyk,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bednarczyk&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1= |editor= |others= |title=Życie codzienne warszawskiego getta; warszawskie getto i ludzie (1939-1945 i dalej) |trans-title=Everyday life of the Warsaw Ghetto: Warsaw Ghetto and its people |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1995 |publisher=Ojczyzna |location=Warsaw |isbn=8386449020 |oclc= |pages= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henryk Iwański]] and Kałmen Mendelson assert, that Paweł Frenkel was one of the deputies of JMU's commander [[Dawid Moryc Apfelbaum]]. However, other accounts, including those by [[Dawid Wdowiński]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Wdowiński&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Wdowinski |author2=Chaim Lazar |editor= |others=Morris Chariton |title=And we are not saved |trans-title= |edition=2 |series= |volume= |year=1985 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |isbn=0802224865 |url=https://www.amazon.ca/We-Are-Not-Saved-ebook/dp/B00XABVSG6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482385680&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=and+we+are+not+saved#reader_B00XABVSG6 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cezary Szemley suggest, that Frenkiel was indeed the leader of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apfelbaum&quot;/&gt; In recent years some historians went as far as to suggest that Apfelbaum did not even exist at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Więź&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dariusz Libionka |author2=Laurence Weinbaum |year=2007 |title=Pomnik Apfelabuma, czyli klątwa &quot;majora&quot; Iwańskiego |trans-title=Monument to Apfelbaum, or the curse of &quot;Major&quot; Iwański |journal=Więź |volume= |issue=4 |pages=100–111 |issn=0511-9405 |url= |accessdate= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Libionka&quot;/&gt;

In any way, it is probable that Paweł Frenkiel personally commanded one of the armed companies of armed fighters during the ill-fated [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943. According to a widespread opinion he was [[killed in action]] while defending the headquarters of the Jewish Military Union at #7 [[Muranów|Muranów Square]]. According to some other sources he was killed on 19 June 1943 in Grzybowska Street in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Libionka&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dariusz Libionka |author2=Laurence Weinbaum |title=Bohaterowie, hochsztaplerzy, opisywacze: wokół Żydowskiego Związku Wojskowego |trans-title=Heroes, Hucksters, Story-tellers: On the Jewish Military Union |year=2011 |publisher=Stowarzyszenie Centrum Badań nad Zagładą Żydów, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] |location=Warsaw |isbn=9788393220281 |oclc= |pages=534–535 |language=pl}} The controversy surrounding Apfelbaum's existence discussed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stars''' is a [[computer graphics]] effect used by [[computer games]]. The effect takes the bright parts of a rendered image of the scene, and then smears them outward in a number of directions. The result is that bright areas have streaks emanating from them. Stars can be used to enhance [[Bloom (Shader Effect)|blooming]]. The effect is also sometimes known as ''light streaks'' or just as the ''star effect''.

'''Clark Calvin Griffith''' (November 20, 1869 - October 27, 1955), nicknamed &quot;the Old Fox&quot;, was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] (1891 - 1914), [[manager (baseball)|manager]] (1901 - 1920) and team owner (1920 - 1955).

Griffith entered the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in [[1891 in sports|1891]], pitching 226 ⅓ innings and winning 14 games for the [[St. Louis Browns]] and [[Boston Reds (1890–1891)|Boston Reds]]. He began the following season with the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts]], and in [[1894 in sports|1894]] began a string of six consecutive seasons with 20 or more victories, compiling a 21-14 record and 4.92 [[earned run average|ERA]]. Griffith lowered his ERA over the following years to a low of 1.88 in [[1898 in sports|1898]], the lowest mark in the league.

Griffith won 20 games for his 7th and final time in [[1901 in sports|1901]] as a member of the [[Chicago White Sox|Chicago White Stockings]] in the nascent [[American League]]; it was also the first year he assumed managerial duties. His success extended beyond his own play as the White Stockings won the AL title with an 83-53 record.

'''''The Fascist''''' ({{lang-it|'''Il federale'''}}) is a 1961  [[Italy|Italian]] [[film]] directed by  [[Luciano Salce]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/91048/The-Fascist/overview The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was coproduced with [[France]]. It was also the first feature film scored by [[Ennio Morricone]].

== Plot ==

The movie takes place in 1944, when Italy was divided between the fascist puppet state [[Repubblica Sociale Italiana]] (controlling the northern half of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;) and the allied-occupied southern half.

Fascist bosses gathered in Cremona (in the far North of Italy and well away from the line of fire) pick enthusiast militant Primo Arcovazzi (played by [[Ugo Tognazzi]]) to take into custody professor Bonafe, a noted anti-fascist philosopher, from the rural location where he was confined in and to lead him to Rome (at the time controlled by the RSI).

Equipped with a motorcycle-sidecar combination Arcovazzi picks up the professor and heads towards the Eternal City; along the way the couple wrecks its vehicle to avoid running over a girl ([[Stefania Sandrelli]]) who turns out to be a confidence trickster and petty thief; and, after having scammed the professor out of 150 [[Italian Lira|lire]], she disappears.

Without a means of transportation Arcovazzi asks a truckload of [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers passing by to help, only to have his sidecar confiscated and be made prisoner (along with his original prisoner) by the German forces.

Ending up in a [[Nazi]]-controlled jail the couple makes good its escape thanks to an allied [[strategic bombing|air raid]], donning German uniforms to pass unnoticed during the commotion but, while Arcovazzi is stealing a [[Schwimmwagen]] Bonafè tries to desert him.

The following night the two men stop to sleep in a barn where they rejoin the thieving girl; she is afraid but they instead ask for her help to kill a chicken they managed to steal along the way.

After having dined together the trio falls asleep; the girl wakes up first and leaves with all of Arcovazzi's and Bonafe's clothes and accessories (save for the vehicle).
Depressed by the events Arcovazzi tries to ford a stream, confiding in the Schwimmwagen's noted amphibious qualities but, due to previous damage or his own ineptitude, the German car sinks.&lt;br&gt;
Reaching a village on foot Arcovazzi tries to ask for help at the local fascist party cell (&quot;Casa del Fascio&quot;) where they only manage to find a couple of teenagers, armed and fanatized by fascist propaganda (which tried to mobilize even students and youngsters for its cause) who, doubting Arcovazzi's sincerity, shower him with questions only a true-blue fascist can answer.

Arcovazzi's naive enthusiasm seems to finally pay off when he answer all of the boys' questions, but the last one leaves him in dire straits (being based more on historical knowledge of the Classical world rather than the agit-prop slogans Arcovazzi is at ease with); with the two kids' fingers on the trigger it's Bonafe (being a dean of Humanities, thus knowledgeable in the subtleties of the Greek and Roman world) who comes to the rescue of his 'jailer', suggesting him the correct answer.
Confiscating a [[tandem bicycle]] and a pistol Arcovazzi is able to resume his odissey, until the former bursts a tire.

Forced on foot once again Arcovazzi decides to stop at Rocca Sabina, home of (fictitious) nationalist poet Arcangelo Bardacci, whom he idolizes and whose writings (which he can quote verbatim) prompted him to become a fascist. Reaching the poet's house he's told by his wife that he went fighting with the Italian Army in Albania and died there. Bardacci however is still alive, having had a change of conscience, having embraced antifascism and biding his time hiding in the cellar until the regime he once endorsed finally collapses.

Arcovazzi is offered hospitality in the poet's house, where Bonafe discovers the truth and is allowed to escape in exchange of a promise of rehabilitation for Bardacci once things settle down.

Arcovazzi however manages to catch him once again, resuming the voyage towards Rome with his &quot;captive&quot;.
Catching a methane powered pullman seems to alleviate the journey's difficulties, but during one of the frequent stops (albeit efficient, methane engines had very limited autonomy, needing many refills), Bonafe escapes for the n-th time.

Pursuing him Arcovazzi manages finally to recapture him, but the pullman is long gone...they finally manage to enter the outskirts of Rome in the dusk hours of early June, 1944.

Unbeknown to them the Italian Capital has just been conquered by the Allies. Groups of [[GI (military)|GI]]s were stationed in the squares, celebrating their victory and preserving public order. The couple is at first oblivious to the fact and manage on the way to cross roads with the young girl once again: Arcovazzi demands his clothes back but she mockingly offers him something &quot;even better&quot;, a full fascist &quot;Federale&quot; uniform. Having been promised the &quot;Federale&quot; rank if successful in his endeavor Arcovazzi eagerly accepts and dons the uniform on the spot, glowing in the regalia he so long dreamed for, while Bonafe scoffs his head.

Passing along the deserted boulevards of Rome (it's still night) they hear the laughs and jokes of a group of soldiers which Arcovazzi at first believes to be German, speaking only Italian and not being able to tell languages apart; the more cultured Bonafe points out that the men are speaking in English, prompting Arcovazzi to dismiss them as [[POW]]s (as German troops had paraded allied POWs through Rome when they contained the [[Anzio]] beachhead earlier in 1944).

But the POWs seem to be a bit too loud and relaxed and, after some inquiry, Arcovazzi is horrified at the discovery that he is, actually, behind the enemy lines (and dressed as a party boss, nonetheless).

The U.S. troops, however, treat him more as a curiosity than as an enemy, they cheer him and take pictures of him instead of shooting him on the spot (as the fascist propaganda maintained in depicting all allied soldiers as bloodthirsty brutes).

The reaction of Italian civilians, however, is wholly different; resenting the failures, the brutality and the empty boasting of fascism they throw themselves at him, menacing to [[Lynching|lynch]] him; Bonafe, who during the whole odissey has grown oddly [[Stockholm Syndrome|fond]] of him has to call on a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] patrol to save Arcovazzi from the mob.

The [[Italian partisans|partisans]], seeing his high-rank uniform, are however inclined to shoot Arcovazzi on the spot; seeing the spirits much too inflamed to be convinced otherwise Bonafe asks for a pistol and the dubious &quot;honour&quot; of shooting his former jailer himself.

Leading the wannabe-&quot;Federale&quot; behind a ruined wall he, throws the weapon away, helps Arcovazzi in removing the uniform which was about to seal his fate and lets him go.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[differential geometry]], a '''quaternion-Kähler symmetric space''' or '''Wolf space''' is a [[quaternion-Kähler manifold]] which, as a Riemannian manifold, is a [[Riemannian symmetric space]]. Any quaternion-Kähler symmetric space with positive Ricci curvature is [[compact space|compact]] and [[simply connected]], and is a Riemannian product of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces associated to compact [[simple Lie group]]s.

For any compact simple Lie group ''G'', there is a unique  ''G''/''H'' obtained as a quotient of ''G'' by a subgroup

:&lt;math&gt; H = K \cdot \mathrm{Sp}(1).\, &lt;/math&gt;

Here, Sp(1) is the compact form of the SL(2)-triple associated with the highest root of ''G'', and ''K'' its [[centralizer]] in ''G''. These are classified as follows.

The [[quaternion-Kähler manifold#Twistor spaces|twistor spaces]] of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are the homogeneous holomorphic [[contact manifold]]s, classified by Boothby: they are the [[adjoint variety|adjoint varieties]] of the complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s.

These spaces can be obtained by taking a [[projectivization]] of
a minimal [[nilpotent orbit]] of the respective complex Lie group.
The holomorphic contact structure is apparent, because
the nilpotent orbits of semisimple Lie groups 
are equipped with the [[Kirillov-Kostant form|Kirillov-Kostant]] holomorphic symplectic form. This argument also explains how one
can associate a unique Wolf space to each of the simple
complex Lie groups.

The '''Gardena Ronda Express''' is a [[funicular]] situated in the [[Val Gherdëina]] near [[Santa Cristina Gherdëina]], connecting the Col Raiser lifts to the Sasslong/Ruacia and Ciampinoi lifts in northern [[Italy]].

== Trains ==
Two funiculars operate on the system. Both were built by [[Gangloff AG|Gangloff]], and the cable system was manufactured by [[Leitner Ropeways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/en/company/references/if-val-gardena-ronda-express-588/ |title=IF Val Gardena Ronda Express |website=Leitner AG }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funicular trains each have four seating cabins capable of seating around 10 and standing around 25. The total capacity is 140 people per train. The trains are {{convert|15.5|m|ftin|frac=8|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2.3|m|ftin|frac=8|abbr=on}} wide, and weigh {{convert|15,500|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

== Track ==
The whole line runs in a tunnel, which connects two [[gondola lift]]s and through them two [[ski resort]]s.  The maximum speed is {{convert|36|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and the slope is 100[[Per mil|‰]] (10[[%]]).  2000 persons can be transported per hour from one terminus to the other.

== History ==
Planning started in 1990 and after some changes on the track to avoid buildings, construction started in 2003. With the line's opening in 2004, after nearly forty years without a railway (the [[Val Gardena Railway]] was closed in 1960), the valley has a train again.

==Characteristics==
RL syndrome is characterized by [[renal dysplasia]], [[growth retardation]], [[phocomelia]] or [[mesomelia]], radiohumeral fusion (joining of [[radius]] and [[humerus]]), [[rib]] abnormalities, anomalies of the external [[genitalia]] and potter-like [[facies]] among many others.&lt;ref name=ORPHA/&gt;&lt;ref name=orph2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/patsgn_data.php?PatId=3002&amp;PatLbl=Ulbright+hodes+syndrome&amp;Asb=Pat&amp;PHPSESSID=3ad9f6172ad44e15a75ae9d10c3983bb |title=ORPHANET - More on Ulbright-Hodes syndrome |accessdate=July 27, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==

RL syndrome is [[heredity|inherited]] in an autosomal recessive manner.&lt;ref name=rlar/&gt; This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''HMS ''Flycatcher''''' was a [[stone frigate]] name for the [[Royal Navy]]'s headquarters for its [[Mobile Naval Air Bases]] which supported their [[Fleet Air Arm]] units.

''Flycatcher'' was based first at [[RNAS Ludham]], [[Norfolk]] then moved to [[RAF Middle Wallop|Middle Wallop]].

On 1 April 1947 [[Kai Tak Airport]] in [[Hong Kong]] was recommissioned as HMS ''Flycatcher''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helis.com/database/go/hk_kai_tak.php Kai Tak - Helicopter Database&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, HMS FLYCATCHER, ex-Turkish motor patrol boat. Built 1912 Thornycroft. Sunk 9.11.14 by HMS ESPIEGLE in Shatt-al-Arab, salvaged, back in service late 1915. Armed with 1-6pdr/1-MG. Sold c1923.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;British Warships 1914-1919&quot; by F J Dittmar &amp; J J Colledge&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Staple''' refers to [[fiber|fibre]] of discrete length and may be of any composition.  A continuous fibre such as natural [[silk]] or synthetic is known as filament rather than staple fibre.

==Etymology==
[[Back-formation]] arising because part of the business of a [[wool-stapler]] was [[Wool classing|to sort and class]] the wool according to [[Wool measurement|quality]]. According to [[Chambers Dictionary]] the actual word &quot;staple&quot; including staple foods and other products comes from the [[Low German]] word ''Stapel'' meaning a heap of goods to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;staple, n.3&quot;. ''OED Online''. June 2011. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staple length==
[[File:PSM V39 D189 Magnified fibers of silk wool and cotton.jpg|thumb|right|Magnified fibres of silk, wool, and cotton]]
Staple length, a property of staple [[fiber|fibre]], is a term referring to the average length of a group of fibres of any composition. Staple length depends on the origin of the fibres. [[Natural fibers|Natural fibres]] (such as [[cotton]] or [[wool]]) have a range of lengths in each sample, so the staple length is an average. For [[synthetic fibers|synthetic fibres]] which have been cut to a certain length, the staple length is the same for every fibre in the group. 

Staple length is an important criterion for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] fibre, as shorter fibres are more difficult to spin than longer ones, so staple length varies from short to longer length fibres, short fibers  also resulting in more hairy yarns. 

For cotton and wool, staple length was originally tested by hand, the tester removing a clump of fibre and then arranging it on a dark cloth for measurement. In the 1970s, machines were invented to do this task, taking around 5 minutes for cotton and for wool around 20 minutes. Today, machinery can take the measurement in seconds.

==Filament==
The opposite term is '''filament''' fibre, which is [[fibre]] that comes in continuous to near continuous lengths for use. [[Silk]], taken from the cocoon of a silkworm, is a filament. Synthetic fibres can also be manufactured as filament. If the filament is then cut into discrete lengths, it becomes staple fibre.

'''''The Narrows''''' is an American 2008 independent film starring [[Kevin Zegers]], [[Sophia Bush]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Eddie Cahill]] and [[Monica Keena]].

==Plot==
The movie is based on Tim McLoughlin's novel ''Heart of the Old Country'', which has Mike Manadoro ([[Kevin Zegers]]) as a 19-year-old [[Brooklyn]] boy who is torn between two worlds. When Mike's photography portfolio wins him a partial scholarship to [[New York University]], he must figure out how to balance his tight-knit Italian neighborhood roots in [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] with the opportunity to blend into the expansive, sophisticated world on the other side of the East River. Since his job at a local car service doesn't earn him enough to make up for the rest of the tuition, and his father, a retired sanitation worker on disability, refuses out of pride to support Mike's attempts for financial aid, Mike ultimately takes a job making deliveries for Tony, the local mob boss, to make up the difference.

Mike not only has to balance work with his academic assignments, he has to manage his personal relationships as well. This includes his attraction to a beautiful, cool, intellectual young woman, Kathy Popovich ([[Sophia Bush]]) he meets at NYU, with his responsibility to his longtime girlfriend Gina ([[Monica Keena]]) from the neighborhood whom he's promised to marry. The stakes grow higher as he faces consequential choices from turning his back on all he knows and pursuing a new life.

A '''teenage tragedy song''' is a style of [[ballad]] in popular music that peaked in popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Examples of the style are also known as &quot;tear jerkers,&quot; &quot;death discs&quot; or &quot;splatter platters&quot;,&lt;ref name=NPRalt&gt;{{cite web| title=Alternative Love Songs from the Teenage Tragedy Vault|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/14/466581799/alternative-love-songs-from-the-teenage-tragedy-vault|date=February 14, 2016|publisher= NPR|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other colorful sobriquets coined by DJs that then passed into vernacular as the songs became popular. Often lamenting teenage death scenarios in [[melodrama]]tic fashion, these songs were usually sung from the viewpoint of the dead person's sweetheart, as in &quot;[[Last Kiss]]&quot;&lt;ref name=LastKiss&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Kiss: The Incredible, Convoluted Story Behind This Classic #1 Hit|url=http://www.forgottenhits.com/last_kiss_the_incredible_convoluted_story_behind_this_1_classic_hit|publisher=Forgotten Hits.|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1961), or another witness to the tragedy, or the dead (or dying) person.&lt;ref name=NPRalt/&gt; Other examples include &quot;[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]]&quot; by [[Mark Dinning]] (1959), &quot;[[Tell Laura I Love Her]]&quot; by [[Ray Peterson]] (1960), &quot;[[Ebony Eyes (John D. Loudermilk song)|Ebony Eyes]]&quot; by [[the Everly Brothers]] (1961), &quot;[[Dead Man's Curve (song)|Dead Man's Curve]]&quot; by [[Jan and Dean]] (1964), and &quot;[[Leader of the Pack]]&quot; by [[the Shangri-Las]] (1964).&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite web| author=Luan Lawrenson-Woods| title=Leader of the Pack|url=http://popularromanceproject.org/leader-of-the-pack/|date= July 2, 2013|publisher= The Popular Romance Project|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre's popularity faded around 1965 (as a mostly American phenomenon, it was one of many musical formats that were drowned out by the [[British Invasion]]),&lt;ref name= Hatbox&gt;{{citation|author= Sheila Burgel|title= One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Song by Song|date= 2005|publisher= Rhino Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; but inspired a host of similar songs and parodies over the years.

==Origins and format==
By the mid-1950s, postwar youth culture in the U.S. was embracing [[rock and roll]], and the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] was also approaching its zenith &amp;ndash; the narrative style of many teenage tragedy songs had similarities to [[folk music|folk]] balladry.&lt;ref name=CNNDeathsong&gt;{{cite news|title= The teenager's death song|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/03/29/eye.ent.teensongs/index.html|author= Todd Leopold|publisher=CNN|date=March 30, 2006|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison ballads (such as [[the Kingston Trio]]'s &quot;[[Tom Dooley (song)|Tom Dooley]]&quot;, based on a folk song about a real murder) and gunfighter ballads (such as [[Johnny Cash]]'s &quot;[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]&quot; and [[Marty Robbins]]' &quot;[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]&quot;), with similar themes of death, were also popular during the heyday of teen tragedy songs.

The teen tragedy genre's popular era began with &quot;[[Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots]]&quot;, written by [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. Released just before 24-year-old actor [[James Dean]]'s death in an automobile accident in the fall of 1955, it climbed the charts immediately afterward.&lt;ref name= Splatter&gt;{{cite web|title= Splatter Platters: A Look at Teenage Tragedy Songs|url= http://www.goretro.com/2013/07/splatter-platters-look-at-teenage.html|publisher=Go Retro|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teenage tragedies had specific thematic&lt;ref name=Zemke&gt;{{cite web|title=Genre Rules with Dr. Kirsten Zemke: 'Teenage Coffin Songs'|url=http://95bfm.com/bcasts/genre-rules-w-dr-kirsten-zemke-12/|date= November 18, 2011|publisher=95bFM, Auckland, New Zealand|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[trope (literature)|tropes]] such as [[star-crossed|star-crossed lovers]],&lt;ref name=Zemke/&gt; reckless youth, eternal devotion, suicide, and despair over lost love; along with lyrical elements that teens of the time could relate to their own lives&lt;ref name=CNNDeathsong/&gt; – such as dating, motorcycles and automobiles (car songs also being popular during the 1950s), and disapproving parents or peers.&lt;ref name=Woods /&gt;&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;{{cite web|url=https://music.avclub.com/screeching-tires-and-busting-glass-defining-the-teen-t-1798252265|title=Screeching tires and busting glass: Defining the teen-tragedy song in 60 minutes|last=Rife|first=Katie|website=AV Club|date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary [[girl group]]s of the '60s also borrowed the genre's melodramatic template (as well as the use of sound effects, orchestration, echo and other sonic touches) for non-fatal but otherwise tragic story-songs, such as [[Reparata and the Delrons]]' over-the-top &quot;Saturday Night Didn't Happen&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Panic,&quot; in 1968. In The Pussycats' 1966 &quot;Dressed in Black&quot;, (co-written by George 'Shadow' Morton, and originally a Shangri-Las B-side) and in &quot;We Don't Belong&quot; by UK singer Sylvan (1965), the heartbreak and melancholy are palpable - and in Sylvan's case, nearly suicidal.&lt;ref name= Hatbox /&gt;

Ethnomusicologist Kirsten Zemke considers these songs as forming a strictly musical genre that was bound by common thematic tropes, musical style and production elements; and as being of their time. As for their popularity, she writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;They sold well in their time, and the style has persisted throughout the decades in various forms. And ….they have an interesting history. The question some writers have asked is “why?”. Some of the reasons suggested for this genre’s macabre popularity are:
:These were the ultimate teen rebellion songs. The only way out of parents’ (and/or societal) control and expectations was death.
:They were a natural extension of the “unrequited love” song, facilitated by the obvious rhyming of: good bye, cry and die.
:There were a number of publicized deaths of pop stars and young actors during that period, including [[Sam Cooke]], [[Johnny Ace]], [[Eddie Cochran]]; and of course [[The Day the Music Died|the plane crash]] that killed [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and the [[Big Bopper]] in 1959. This might explain the interest in songs around death, tragedy and sorrow.&quot;&lt;ref name=Zemke2&gt;{{cite web| title=What the Genre?

==Deathless themes==
Teenagers meeting with tragedy in song was not new in the 1950s (or for that matter in the 1650s, around the time &quot;[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]&quot; was popular). In literature, it has been a recurring and resonant  theme over centuries, most notably in [[William Shakespeare]]'s &quot;[[Romeo and Juliet]]&quot;.  Another early example in song is &quot;[[Oh My Darling, Clementine]]&quot;, published in 1884 but based on earlier songs and apparently written as a parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C5AdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=song+%22my+darling+clementine%22+parody&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo8oXDrJXMAhVG1RQKHZ48CHsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=song+%22my+darling+clementine%22+parody&amp;f=false|title=Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|first=Andrew|last=Butler|date=31 October 2014|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|page=9|accessdate=22 March 2019|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As popular music and the society it mirrored changed from the late 1960s onward, the themes carried on in different forms and styles. Songs and spoken-word productions about the dangers of drug abuse joined the parade of [[pathos]] on radio airwaves, ranging from three-minute morality plays to lamentations (from the parental perspective) on the [[generation gap]]. These include &quot;Once You Understand&quot; by Think (U.S. #23, 1971) and radio and TV host [[Art Linkletter]]'s [[Grammy]]-winning single &quot;We Love You, Call Collect&quot; (U.S. #42, 1969).  Recorded before his daughter Diane's apparent suicide in 1969, the record also included Diane speaking the reply, &quot;Dear Mom and Dad&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/05/26/tv-host-art-linkletter-passes-away/|title=TV Show Host Art Linkletter Dies at 97|date=2010-05-26|website=Foxnews.com|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Into the 1970s, as the [[Vietnam War]] continued, hit ballads of youth and death included [[B. J. Thomas]]' &quot;Billy and Sue&quot; (1972) and [[Terry Jacks]]' No. 1 hit &quot;[[Seasons in the Sun]]&quot; (1974), their protagonists of indeterminate age, or slightly older than teens.  A song that was thought to have referenced the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was [[Paper Lace]]'s 1974 hit &quot;[[Billy Don't Be a Hero]],&quot; made a bigger hit in the U.S. by [[Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods]]. Hard-rock acts recorded vehicular death scenarios such as &quot;[[Children's Heritage/D.O.A.|D.O.A.]]&quot; ([[Bloodrock]], 1971), &quot;[[Detroit Rock City]]&quot; ([[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], 1976) and &quot;[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]&quot; ([[Meat Loaf]], 1977).

By the end of the 1970s, teenage tragedy would chart without the element of melodrama – in 1979, &quot;[[I Don't Like Mondays]]&quot; by the [[Boomtown Rats]], written by [[Bob Geldof]] in response to a senseless school shooting in the news while he was on tour in the U.S., went to No. 1 in the UK, and No. 4 in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clarke | first=Steve | title=The Fastest Lip on Vinyl | work=[[Smash Hits]] | publisher=EMAP National Publications Ltd | date=18–31 October 1979 | pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Smiths]] 1987 song &quot;[[Girlfriend in a Coma (song)|Girlfriend in a Coma]]&quot; also took inspiration from teenage tragedy songs, by taking the melodramatic aspect and pushing it to extremes.  Some songs merely updated the sound of the previous era, such as &quot;Racing Car&quot; by Dutch group [[:nl:Air Bubble|Air Bubble]] (1976), while others used the melodic and stylistic tropes of teen tragedy in tougher, grittier settings, as in the [[Ramones]]' &quot;You're Gonna Kill That Girl&quot; (1977) and &quot;7-11&quot; (1981), [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]]' &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (1999), [[Eminem]]'s &quot;[[Stan (song)|Stan]]&quot; (2000), and [[Gord Downie]]'s album ''[[Secret Path]]'' (2016).  &quot;[[Teen Idle]]&quot; by [[Marina and the Diamonds]] (2012), evoking an [[archetype]] of disenfranchised youth, is a thematic heir to the original teen tragedy oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/electra-heart-mw0002328372|title=''Electra Heart''&amp;nbsp;– Marina and the Diamonds|last=Monger|first=James Christopher|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satires and parodies==

* &quot;Let's Think About Living&quot; (1960), with [[Bob Luman]] mocking the then-current musical trend.
* “Valerie”, a 1961 [[doo-wop]] styled teen tragedy spoof by The Mark III, a young folk trio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Man/Valerie 45|url= http://www.45cat.com/record/nc927137us#comments |publisher= 45cat|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;All I Have Left is Johnny's Hubcap&quot; on the 1962 parody album, ''Mad “Twists” Rock ’n’ Roll'', produced in association with ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine.

* &quot;Jenny Brown&quot;, from the 1964 [[Smothers Brothers]] album ''[[It Must Have Been Something I Said!]]'', has a melody and lyrics in the opening verses mimicking a typical &quot;dead teenager&quot; song.

*&quot;Leader of the Laundromat&quot; by [[the Detergents]] (1964), a direct parody of the Shangri-Las' hit, written by [[Paul Vance]] and [[Lee Pockriss]].

* [[Jimmy Cross]]'s &quot;I Want My Baby Back&quot; (1965), a [[novelty record]] about a fatal head-on collision with &quot;The Leader of the Pack,&quot; narrated in a down-home patter reminiscent of [[Andy Griffith]]. The single made the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] (reaching #92), and became a cult classic years later from airplay on [[Dr. Demento]]'s syndicated radio show; it is also included on the ''World's Worst Records'' compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Jimmy Cross: I Want My Baby Back|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRJ8BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22Teenage+Tragedies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl5v7y_P_LAhXCSBQKHYgVDpAQ6AEITzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Teenage%20Tragedies%22&amp;f=false|author=Daryl W. Bullock|work= The World's Worst Records: Volume One: An Arcade of Audio Atrocity|date=2015|publisher=Bristol Green Publishing|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is included on [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]]'s 1984 compilation LP ''[[Teenage Tragedies]].''
*In a 1965 episode of ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', &quot;Lucy in the Music World,&quot; [[Lucille Ball]] tried to appeal to teenagers with a song about a boyfriend whose &quot;surfboard came back by itself.&quot; She had been advised that youth today &quot;aren't happy unless they're miserable.&quot;&lt;ref name= Splatter/&gt;
* &quot;[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab for Cutie]]&quot; by the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] (1967), the inspiration for [[Death Cab for Cutie|the band]] of the same name.
* [[Randy Newman]]'s song &quot;Lucinda&quot;, on his 1970 album ''[[12 Songs (Randy Newman album)|12 Songs]]'', concerns a girl who falls asleep on the beach in her [[graduation]] gown, and is killed and buried by a [[Sand cleaning machine|beach cleaning machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KBo8RQLpwtUC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22johnny+cymbal%22+%22water+was+red%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnianXsPvOAhVFVRQKHdksAaYQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22johnny+cymbal%22+%22water+was+red%22&amp;f=false|title=Randy Newman's American Dreams|first=Kevin|last=Courrier|date=22 March 2019|page=104|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|accessdate=22 March 2019|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[John Entwistle]]'s &quot;Roller Skate Kate,&quot; from his 1973 album ''[[Rigor Mortis Sets In]]'', the heroine is killed while skating in the high-speed lane of the motorway.
*[[10cc]]'s 1973 song &quot;Johnny Don't Do It,&quot; done in the style of early 1960s girl-group songs, with the trope of the bad boy who is good but misunderstood. Johnny steals a motorcycle and hits a truck, killing his girlfriend along with himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/johnny-dont-do-it-lyrics-10-cc.html |title=10 Cc - Johnny Don't Do It Lyrics |website=MetroLyrics.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brian DePalma]]'s 1974 film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' satirizes the genre in musical numbers including the opening song, &quot;Goodbye Eddie Goodbye&quot; by fictional band The Juicy Fruits.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
*Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin, and Laraine Newman recorded a song for season 2 of ''Saturday Night Live'' entitled &quot;Chevy, Chevy&quot; which is a send-up of teen tragedy, presenting [[Chevy Chase]] as a teen idol.
* On ''The [[Rich Little]] Show'' of March 8, 1976, [[Tom Bosley]] and &quot;[[Welcome Back, Kotter|Sweathogs]]&quot; [[Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs]], [[Robert Hegyes]], and [[Ron Palillo]] sang a parody of the genre called &quot;Pizza Death,&quot; in which the simple-minded driver of a pizzeria delivery van crashed, affording the by-standers an opportunity for free pizza.
* &quot;My Baby's the Star of a Driver's Ed Movie,&quot; a 1983 song by [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]].
* &quot;[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]&quot; by comedian and singer [[Julie Brown]]. Released nationally in 1984, the song (along with an accompanying video in heavy [[MTV]] rotation) was both a parody of the genre, and a satire of [[valley girl]] culture.&lt;ref name=JulieBrown&gt;{{cite web| title=The Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun - Julie Brown |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/homecoming.queen.html|publisher=The Demented Music Database|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
