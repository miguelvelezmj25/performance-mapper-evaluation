Auel  The woman caught a glimpse of movement through the dusty haze ahead and wondered if it was the wolf she had seen loping in front of them earlier.  She glanced at her companion with a worried frown, then looked for the wolf again, straining to see through the blowing dust.  "Jondalar! Look!" she said, pointing ahead.  Toward her left, the vague outlines of several conical tents could just be seen through the dry, gritty wind.  The wolf was stalking some two-legged creatures that had begun to Materialize out of the dusty air, carrying spears aimed directly at them.  "I think we've reached the river, but I don't think we're the only ones who wanted to camp there, Ayla," the man said, pulling on the lead rein to halt his horse.  The woman signaled her horse to a stop by tightening a thigh mus cle, exerting a subtle pressure that was so reflexive she didn't even think of it as controlling the animal.  Ayla heard a menacing growl from deep in the wolf's throat and saw that his posture had shifted from a defensive stance to an aggressive one. He was ready to attack! She whistled, a sharp, distinctive sound that resembled a bird call, though not from a bird anyone had ever heard. The wolf gave up his stealthy pursuit and bounded toward the woman astride the horse.  "Wolf, stay close!" she said, signaling with her hand at the same time. The wolf trotted beside the dun yellow mare as the woman and man on horseback slowly approached the people standing between them and the tents.  A gusty, fitful wind, holding the fine loess soil in suspension, swirled around them, obscuring their view of the spear holders. Ayla lifted her leg over and slid down from the horse's back. She knelt beside the wolf, put one arm over his back and the other across his chest, to calm him and hold him back if necessary. She could feel the snarl rumbling in his throat and the eager tautness of muscles ready to spring. She looked up at Jondalar. A light film of powdery dirt coated the shoulders and long flaxen hair of the tall man and turned the coat of his dark brown mount to the more common dun color of the sturdy breed. She and Whinney looked the same. Though it was still early in the sum mer, the strong winds off the massive glacier to the north were already desiccating the steppes in a wide band south of the ice.  She felt the wolf tense and strain against her arm, then saw someone new appear from behind the spear holders, dressed as Mamut might have dressed for an important ceremony, in a mask with aurochs's horns and in clothes painted and decorated with enigmatic symbols.  The mamut shook a staff at them vigorously and shouted, "Go away, evil spirits! Leave this place!" Ayla thought it was a woman's voice shouting through the mask, but she wasn't sure; the words had been spoken in Mamutoi, though. The mamut dashed toward them shaking the staff again, while Ayla held back the wolf. Then the costumed figure began chanting and dancing, shaking the staff and high-stepping toward them quickly, then back again, as though trying to scare them off or drive them away, and succeeding, at least, in frightening the horses.  She was surprised that Wolf was so ready to attack, wolves seldom threatened people. But, remembering behavior she had observed, she thought she understood. Ayla had often watched wolves when she was teaching herself to hunt, and she knew they were affectionate and loyal to their own pack. But they were quick to drive strangers away from their territory, and they had been known to kill other wolves to protect what they felt was theirs.  To the tiny wolf pup she had found and brought back to the Ma mutoi earthlodge, the Lion Camp was his pack; other people would be like strange wolves to him. He had growled at unknown humans who had come to visit when he was barely half-grown. Now, in unfamiliar territory, perhaps the territory of another pack, it would be natural for him to feel defensive when he first became aware of strangers, espe cially hostile strangers with spears. Why had the people of this Camp drawn spears?  Ayla thought there was something familiar about the chant; then she realized what it was. The words were in the sacred archaic language that was understood only by the mamuti. Ayla didn't understand all of it, Mamut had just begun to teach her the language before she left, but she did gather that the meaning of the loud chant was essentially the same as the words that had been shouted earlier, though cast in somewhat more cajoling terms. It was an exhortation to the strange wolf and horse-people spirits to go away and leave them alone, to go back to the spirit world where they belonged. Speaking in Zeiandonii so the people from the Camp wouldn't understand, Ayla told Jondalar what the mamut was saying.  "They think we're spirits? Of course!" he said. "I should have known. They're afraid of us. That's why they're threatening us with spears. Ayla, we may have this problem every time we meet people along the way. We are used to the animals now, but most people have never thought of horses or wolves as anything but food or pelts," he said.  "The Mamutoi at the Summer Meeting were upset in the beginning.  It took them a while to get used to the idea of having the horses and Wolf around, but they got over it," Ayla said.  "When I opened my eyes that first time in the cave in your valley and saw you helping Whinney give birth to Racer, I thought the lion had killed me and I had awakened in the spirit world," Jondalar said.  "Maybe I should get down, too, and show them I am a man and not attached to Racer like some kind of man-horse spirit." Jondalar dismounted, but he held on to the rope attached to the halter he had made. Racer was tossing his head and trying to back away from the advancing mamut, who was still shaking the staff and chanting loudly. Whinney was behind the kneeling woman, with her head down, touching her. Ayla used neither ropes nor halters to guide her horse. She directed the horse entirely with the pressures of her legs and the movements of her body.  Catching a few sounds of the strange language the spirits spoke, and seeing Jondalar dismount, the shaman chanted louder, pleading with the spirits to go away, promising them ceremonies, trying to placate them with offers of gifts.  "I think you should tell them who we are," Ayla said. "That mamut is getting very upset." Jondalar held the rope close to the stallion's head. Racer was alarmed and trying to rear, and the mamut with her staff and shouting didn't help. Even Whinney looked ready to Spock, and she was usually much more even-tempered than her excitable offspring.  "We are not spirits," Jondalar called out when the mamut paused for a breath. "I am a visitor, a traveler on a Journey, and she"--he pointed toward Ayla--"is Mamutoi, of the Mammoth Hearth." The people glanced at each other with questioning looks, and the mamut stopped shouting and dancing, but still shook the staff now and then while studying them. Maybe they were spirits who were playing tricks, but at least they had been made to speak in a language everyone could understand. Finally the mamut spoke.  "Why should we believe you? How do we know you are not trying to trick us? You say she is of the Mammoth Hearth, but where is her mark? She has no tattoo on her face." Ayla spoke up. "He didn't say I was a mamut. He said I was of the Mammoth Hearth. The old Mamut of the Lion Camp was teaching me before I left, but I am not fully trained." The mamut conferred with a man and a woman, then turned back.  "This one," she said, nodding toward Jondalar, "he is as he says, a visitor. Though he speaks well enough, it is with the tones of a foreign tongue. You say you are Mamutoi, yet something about the way you speak is not Mamutoi." Jondalar caught his breath and waited. Ayla did have an unusual quality to her speech. There were certain sounds she could not quite make, and the way she said them was curiously unique. It was per fectly clear what she meant, and not unpleasant—he rather liked it— but it was noticeable. It wasn't quite like the accent of another lan guage; it was more than that, and different. Yet it was just that: an accent, but of a language most people had not heard and would not even recognize as speech. Ayla spoke with the accent of the difficult, guttural, vocally limited language of the people who had taken in the young orphan girl and raised her.  "I was not born to the Mamutoi," Ayla said, still holding Wolf back, though his growl had ceased. "I was adopted by the Mammoth Hearth, by Mamut, himself." There was a flurry of conversation among the people, and another private consultation between the mamut and the woman and man.  "If you are not of the spirit world, how do you control that wolf and make horses take you on their backs?" the mamut asked, deciding to come right out with it.  "It's not hard to do if you find them when they are young," Ayla said.  "You make it sound so simple. There must be more to it than that." The woman couldn't fool a mamut, who was also of the Mammoth Hearth.  "I was there when she brought the wolf pup to the lodge," Jondalar tried to explain. "He was so young that he was still nursing, and I was sure he would die. But she fed him cut-up meat and broth, waking up in the middle of the night as you do with a baby. When he lived, and started to grow, everyone was surprised, but that was only the begin ning. Later, she taught him to do what she wished—not to pass water or make messes inside the lodge, not to snap at the children even when they hurt him. If I hadn't been there, I would not have believed a wolf could be taught so much or would understand so much. It's true, you must do more than find them young. She cared for him like a child.  She is a mother to that animal, that's why he does what she wants." "What about the horses?" the man who was standing beside the shaman asked. He'd been eying the spirited stallion, and the tall man who was controlling him.  "It is the same with the horses. You can teach them if you find them young and take care of them. It takes time and patience, but they will learn." The people had lowered their spears and were listening with great interest. Spirits weren't known to speak in ordinary language, although all the talk of mothering animals was just the kind of strange talk that spirits were known for--words that were not quite what they seemed.  Then the woman of the Camp spoke. "I don't know about being a mother to animals, but I do know that the Mammoth Hearth doesn't adopt strangers and make them Mamutoi. It's not an ordinary hearth.  It is dedicated to Those Who Serve the Mother. People choose the Mammoth Hearth, or are chosen. I have kin in the Lion Camp. Mamut is very old, perhaps the oldest man living. Why would he want to adopt anyone? And I don't think Lutie would have allowed it. What you say is very difficult to believe, and I don't know why we should." Ay la sensed something ambiguous in the way the woman spoke, or rather in the subtle mannerisms that accompanied her words: the stiffness of.her back, the tension in the set of her shoulders, the anxious frown. She seemed to be anticipating something unpleasant.  Then Ayla realized that it wasn't a slip of the tongue; the woman had purposely put a lie in her statement, a subtle trick in her question.  But because of her unique background, the trick was blatantly transparent.  The people who had raised Ayla, known as flatheads, but who called themselves Clan, communicated with depth and precision, though not primarily with words. Few people understood they had a language at all. Their ability to articulate was limited and they were often reviled as less than human, animals that could not talk. They used a language of gestures and signs, but it was no less complex.  The relatively few words the Clan spoke--which Jondalar could hardly reproduce, just as she was not quite able to pronounce certain sounds in Zeiandonii or Mamutoi--were made with a peculiar kind of vocalization, and they were usually used for emphasis, or for names of people or things. Nuances and fine shades of meaning were indicated by bearing, posture, and facial aspects, which added depth and variety to the language, just as tones and inflections did in verbal language.  But with such an overt means of communication, it was almost impos- sible to express an untruth without signaling the fact; they could not lie.  Ayla had learned to perceive and understand the subtle signals of body movement and facial expression as she was learning to speak with signs; it was necessary for complete comprehension. When she was releaming to speak verbally from Jondalar, and becoming fluent in Mamutoi, Ayla discovered that she was perceiving the inadvertent signals that were contained in the slight movements of face and posture even of people who spoke with words, though such gestures were not intentionally meant to be a part of their language.  She discovered that she was understanding more than words, though it caused her some confusion and distress at first, because the words that were spoken did not always match the signals that were given, and she did not know about lies. The closest she could come to untruth was to refrain from speaking.  Eventually she learned that certain small lies were often meant as courtesies. But it was when she gained an understanding of humor— which usually depended on saying one thing but meaning another— that she suddenly grasped the nature of spoken language, and the people who used it. Then her ability to interpret unconscious signals added an unexpected dimension to her developing language skills: an almost uncanny perception of what people really meant. It gave her an unusual advantage. Though she wasn't able to lie herself, except by omission, she usually knew when someone else was not telling the truth.  "There was no one named Lutie in the Lion Camp when I was there." Ayla decided to be direct. "Tulie is the headwoman, and her brother Talut is the headman." The woman nodded imperceptibly as Ayla went on.  "I know that a person is usually dedicated to the Mammoth Hearth, not adopted. Talut and Nezzie were the ones who asked me, Talut even enlarged the earthlodge to make a special winter shelter for the horses, but the old Mamut surprised everyone. During the ceremony, he adopted me. He said that I belonged to the Mammoth Hearth, that I was born to it." "If you brought those horses with you to Lion Camp, I can under stand why old Mamut might say that," the man said.  The woman looked at him with annoyance and said a few words under her breath. Then the three people spoke together again. The man had decided the strangers were probably people and not spirits playing a trick—or if they were, not harmful ones—but he did not believe they were exactly who they claimed to be. The tall man's explanation for the strange behavior of the animals was too simple, our he was interested. The horses and wolf intrigued him. The woman felt they spoke too easily, volunteered too much, were too forthcoming, and she was sure there was more to it than either of them said. She didn't trust them and she wanted nothing to do with them.  The mamut's acceptance of them as human came only after apprehending another thought that would, to one who understood such things, account for the extraordinary behavior of the animals much more plausibly. She was sure the blond woman was a powerful Caller, [and the old Mamut must have known she was born with an uncanny I control over animals. Perhaps the man was, too. Later, when their I Camp arrived at the Summer Meeting, it would be interesting to talk ;to the Lion Camp, and the mamuti would be sure to have some ithoughts about these two. It was easier to believe in magic than the preposterous notion that animals could be domesticated.  During their consultation, there was a disagreement. The woman was uncomfortable, the strangers disturbed her. If she had thought about it, she might have admitted she was afraid. She didn't like being I'll around such an overt demonstration of occult power, but she was i overruled. The man spoke.  "This place where the rivers join is a good place to camp. We have had good hunting, and a herd of giant deer are coming this way. They should be here in a few days. We will not mind if you choose to camp nearby and join us in the hunt." "We appreciate your offer," Jondalar said. "We may camp nearby for the night, but we must be on our way in the morning." It was a guarded offer, not quite the welcoming that he had often received from strangers when he and his brother had traveled together on foot. The formal greeting, given in the name of the Mother, offered more than hospitality. It was considered an invitation to join them, to stay with them and live among them for a time. The man's more limited invitation showed their uncertainty, but at least they weren't being threatened with spears any more.  "Then, in the name of Mut, at least share an evening meal with us, and eat with us in the morning, too." That much welcome the headman could offer, and Jondalar sensed he would have liked to offer more.  "In the name of the Great Earth Mother, we would be happy to eat with you tonight, after we have set up our camp," Jondalar agreed, "but we must leave early." "Where are you going in such a hurry?" The directness that was typical of the Mamutoi still caught Jondalar by surprise, even after all the time he'd lived with them, especially when it came from a stranger. The headman's question would have been thought somewhat impolite among Jondalar's people; not a major indiscretion, just a sign of immaturity, or lack of appreciation for the more subtle and indirect speech of knowing adults.  But, Jondalar had learned, candor and directness were considered proper among the Mamutoi, and lack of openness was suspect, though their ways were not as completely open as they seemed. Subtleties existed. It was a matter of how one expressed directness, how it was received, and what was not said. But the forthright curiosity of the headman of this Camp was, among the Mamutoi, entirely appropriate.  "I am going home," Jondalar said, "and I'm bringing this woman back with me." "Why should a day or two make any difference?" "My home is far to the west. I've been gone..." Jondalar stopped to consider, "four years, and it will take another year to get back, if we are lucky. There are some dangerous crossings—rivers and ice—along the way, and I don't want to reach them at the wrong season." "West? It looks like you're traveling south." "Yes. We are heading for Beran Sea and the Great Mother River.  We will follow her upstream." "My cousin went west on a trading mission, some years back. He said some people there live near a river they also call the Great Mother," the man said. "He thought it was the same one. They trav eled west from here. Depends how far upstream you want to go, but there is a passage south of the Great Ice, but north of the mountains to the west. You might make your Journey much shorter by going that way." "Talut told me of the northern route, but no one seems to be sure that it is the same river. If it's not, it could take longer trying to find the right one. I came the southern way, and I know that route. Besides, I have kin among the River People. My brother was mated to a Shara- mudoi woman, and I lived with them. I'd like to see them once more.  It's not likely that I will ever see them again." "We trade with the River People... seems to me I did hear about some strangers, a year or two ago, living with that group that a Mamutoi woman joined. It was two brothers, now that I think about it. The Sharamudoi have different mating customs, but as I recall, she and her mate were going to be joining with another couple—some kind of an adoption, I suppose. They sent word inviting any Mamutoi relations who wanted to come. Several went, and one or two have gone back since." "That was my brother, Thonolan," Jondalar said, pleased that the account tended to verify his story, although he still could not say his brother's name without feeling pain. "It was his Matrimonial. He joined with Jetamio, and they became cross-mates with Markeno and Tholie. Tholie was the one who first taught me to speak Mamutoi." "Tholie is a distant cousin of mine, and you are the brother of one of her mates?" The man turned to his sister. "Thurie, this man is kin.  I think we must welcome them." Without waiting for an answer, he said, "I am Rutan, headman of Falcon Camp. In the name of Mut, the Great Mother, you are welcome." The woman had no choice. She would not embarrass her brother by refusing to extend a welcome along with him, though she thought of a few choice things to say to him privately. "I am Thurie, headwoman of Falcon Camp. In the name of the Mother, you are welcome here. In summer, we are Feather Grass Camp." It was not the warmest welcome he had ever received. Jondalar detected a definite reservation and restriction. She was welcoming him "here," to this place specifically, but this was a temporary location. He knew Feather Grass Camp referred to any summer hunting camp site.  The Mamutoi were sedentary in the winter, and this group, like the rest, lived in a permanent encampment or community of one or two large or several smaller semisubterranean earthlodges, which they called Falcon Camp. She had not welcomed him there.  "I am Jondalar of the Zeiandonii, I greet you in the name of the Great Earth Mother, whom we call Doni." "We do have extra sleeping places in the mamut's tent," Thurie continued, "but I don't know about the... animals." "If you would not mind," Jondalar said, if only for the sake of courtesy, "it would be easier for us to set up our own camp nearby, rather than stay within your Camp. We appreciate your hospitality, but the horses need to graze, and they know our tent and will return to it. They might be uneasy coming into your Camp." "Of course," Thurie said, relieved. They would make her uneasy, too.  Ayla realized she needed to exchange welcomes, too. Wolf seemed less defensive, and Ayla tentatively relaxed her hold on him. I can't sit here holding Wolf all the time, she thought. When she stood up, he started to jump up on her, but she motioned him down.  Without extending his hands or offering to come any closer, Rutan welcomed her to his Camp. She returned the greeting, in kind. "I am Ayla of the Mamutoi," she said, then added, "of the Mammoth Hearth. I greet you in the name of Mut." Thurie added her welcome, hedging to restrict it to only this place, as she had done with Jondalar. Ay la responded formally. She wished more friendliness had been shown, but she supposed she couldn't blame them. The concept of animals traveling willingly with people could be frightening. Not everyone would be as accepting as Talut had been of the strange innovation, Ayla realized, and with a pang, she felt the loss of the people she loved from Lion Camp.  Ayla turned to Jondalar. "Wolf is not feeling so protective now. I think he will mind me, but I should have something to restrain him while he's around this Camp, and for later, to hold him back in case we meet other people," she said in Zeiandonii, not feeling able to speak freely around this Camp of Mamutoi, though wishing she could.  "Maybe something like that rope guider you made for Racer, Jondalar.  There's a lot of spare rope and thongs in the bottom of one of my pack baskets. I am going to have to teach him not to go after strangers like that; he has to learn to stay where I want him to." Wolf must have understood that raising their spears was a threatening gesture. She could hardly blame him for springing to the defense of the people and horses that made up his strange pack. From his point of view, it was perfectly understandable, but that didn't mean it was acceptable. He could not approach all the people they might meet on their Journey as though they were strange wolves. She would have to teach him to modify his behavior, to meet unknown people with more restraint. Even as the thought came to her, she wondered if there were other people who understood that a wolf would respond to the wishes of a woman, or that a horse would let a human ride on his back.  "You stay there with him. I'll get the rope," Jondalar said. Still holding on to Racer's lead, though the young stallion had calmed down, he looked for the rope in Whinney's pack baskets. The hostility of the Camp had abated somewhat, the people seemed hardly more guarded than they would be toward any strangers. From the way they were watching, their fear seemed to have been replaced by curiosity.  Whinney had settled down, too. Jondalar scratched and patted her and spoke affectionately while he rummaged through the pack baskets.  He was more than fond of the sturdy mare, and though he loved Racer's high spirits, he admired Whinney's serene patience. She had a calming effect on the young stallion. He tied Racer's lead rope to the thong that held the pack baskets on his dam. Jondalar often wished he could control Racer the way Ayla controlled Whinney, with no halter or lead rope. But as he rode the animal, he was discovering the amazing sensitivity of a horse's skin, developing a good seat, and beginning to guide Racer with pressure and posture. Avia moved to the other side of the mare with Wolf. When Jondalar gave her the rope, he spoke to her quietly. "We don't have to stay here, Avia. It's still early. We can find another place, on this river or another." "I think it's a good idea for Wolf to get used to people, especially strangers, and even if they're not too friendly, I wouldn't mind visiting.  They are Mamutoi, Jondalar, my people. These may be the last Mamutoi I will ever see. I wonder if they are going to the Summer Meeting? Maybe we can send a message to Lion Camp with them." Ayla and Jondalar set up their own camp a short distance away from Feather Grass Camp, upstream along the large tributary. They unpacked the horses and let them free to graze. Ayla felt a moment of concern watching them disappear into the dusty blowing haze, as they wandered away from their camp.  The woman and man had been traveling along the right bank of a large river, but some distance from it. Though flowing generally south, the river meandered across the landscape, twisting and turning as it gouged a deep trench out of the flat plains. By keeping to the steppes above the river valley, the travelers could take a more direct route, but one that was exposed to the unremitting wind and the harsher effects of sun and rain on open terrain.  "Is this the river Talut talked about?" Ayla asked, unrolling her sleeping furs.  The man reached into one of a pair of pack baskets for a rather large, flat piece of mammoth tusk with markings incised on it. He looked up toward the section of the dingy sky that glowed with an unbearably bright but diffused light, then at the obscured landscape. It was late afternoon, that much he could tell, but not much more.  "There's no way to know, Ayla," Jondalar said, putting the map back. "I can't see any landmarks, and I'm used to judging the distance traveled by my own legs. Racer moves at a different pace." "Will it really take a whole year to reach your home?" the woman asked.  "It's hard to say for sure. Depends on what we find along the way, how many problems we have, how often we stop. If we make it back to the Zeiandonii by this time next year, we can count ourselves lucky.  We haven't even reached Beran Sea, where the Great Mother River ends, and we will have to follow her all the way to the glacier at her source, and then beyond," Jondalar said. His eyes, an intense and unusually vivid shade of blue, looked worried, and his forehead Wrinkled in a familiar furrow of concern. "We'll have some large rivers to cross, but it's that glacier that worries me most, Ayla. We have to cross over it when the ice is frozen solid, which means we have to reach it before spring, and that's always unpredictable. A strong south wind blows in that region that can warm the deepest cold to melting in one day. Then the snow and ice on top melt, and break up like rotten wood. Wide cracks open and the snow bridges over them collapse; streams, even rivers of meltwater flow across the ice, sometimes disappearing into deep holes. It's very dangerous then, and it can happen very suddenly. It's summer now, and though winter may seem a long way off, we have much farther to travel than you might think." The woman nodded. There was no point in even thinking about how long the Journey would take, or what would happen when they arrived. Better to think of each day as it came, and plan only for the next day or two. Better not to worry about Jondalar's people, and whether they would accept her as one of them the way the Mamutoi had.  "I wish it would stop blowing," she commented.  "I am tired of eating grit, too," Jondalar said. "Why don't we go visit our neighbors, and see if we can get something better to eat." They took Wolf with them when they returned to Feather Grass Camp, but Ayla kept him close. They joined a group that had gathered near a fire over which a large rump was spitted. Conversation was slow to start, but it wasn't long before curiosity became warm interest and fearful reserve gave way to animated talk. The few people who inhabited those periglacial steppes had little opportunity to meet anyone new, and the excitement of this chance encounter would fuel discussions and fill the stories of Falcon Camp for a long time to come. Ayla became friendly with several of the people, particularly a young woman with a baby daughter just at the age of sitting unassisted and laughing out loud, who charmed them all, but mostly Wolf.  The young mother was very nervous at first when the animal singled out her child for his solicitous attention, but when his eager licks made her giggle with delight, and he showed gentle restraint, even when she grabbed handfuls of fur and pulled, everyone was surprised.  The other children were eager to touch him, and before long Wolf was playing with them. Ayla explained that the wolf had grown up with the children of Lion Camp, and probably missed them. He had always been especially gentle with the very young, or the weak, and he seemed to know the difference between the unintentional overzeal- ous squeeze from a toddler and the purposeful pull of a tail or ear by an older child. He allowed the former with patient forebearance, and  repaid the latter with a warning growl, or a gentle nip that did not Illx^k skin but showed that he could.  T londalar mentioned that they had recently left the Summer Meeting, A and Rutan told them that necessary repairs to their earthlodge had fr delayed their departure or they would have been there. He asked fondalar about his travels and about Racer, with many people listening.  They seemed more reluctant to question Ayla, and she didn't volunteer much, though the mamut would have liked to have taken her aside for private discussions of more esoteric subjects, but she preferred to stay with the Camp. Even the headwoman was more relaxed and friendly by the time they headed back to their own camp, and Ayla asked her to pass on her love and remembrances to Lion Camp when they finally reached the Summer Meeting.  That night, Ayla lay awake thinking. She was glad she had not let natural hesitation about joining the Camp that had been less than welcoming stop her. Given the opportunity to overcome their fear of the strange or unknown, they had been interested and willing to learn.  She had learned, too, that traveling with such unusual companions was likely to inspire strong reactions from anyone they might happen to meet along the way. She had no idea what to expect, but there could be little doubt that this Journey was going to be far more challenging than she had imagined.  'ondalar was eager to be off early the next morning, but Ayla wanted to go back and see the acquaintances she had made at Feather Grass Camp before they left, and while Jondalar grew impatient, Ayla spent some time making her farewells. When they finally left, it was near noon.  7or The open grassland of gently rolling hills and far-seeing distances, through which they had been traveling since they left the Summer Meeting, was gaining elevation. The fast-moving current of the tributary river, originating on higher ground, surged with more vigor than the meandering main stream, and it cut a deep channel with steep banks through the wind-sifted loess soil. Though Jondalar wanted to go south, they were forced to travel west, then northwest, while they looked for a convenient place to cross.  The farther they traveled out of their way, the more irritable and impatient Jondalar felt. In his mind, he was questioning his decision to take the longer southern route, rather than the northwestern one that had been suggested--more than once--and in which direction the river seemed determined to take them. True, he wasn't familiar with it, but if it was so much shorter, perhaps they should go that way. If he could just be certain that they would reach the plateau glacier farther to the west, at the source of the Great Mother River, before spring, he would do it, he told himself.  It would mean giving up his last opportunity to see the Sharamudoi, but was that so important? He had to admit that he did want to see them. He had been looking forward to it. Jondalar wasn't sure if his decision to go south really came from his desire to take the familiar, and therefore, safer way to get Ayla and himself back, or his desire to see people who were family to him. He worried about the consequences of making the wrong choice.  Ayla broke into his introspection. "Jondalar, I think we can cross here," she said. "The bank on the other side looks easy to get up." They were at a bend in the river, and they stopped to study the  situation. As the turbulent, swiftly flowing stream swept around the curve, it cut deeply into the outside edge, where they were standing, making a high, steep bank. But the inner side of the turn, on the opposite bank, rose gradually out of the water, forming a narrow shore of hard-packed gray-brown soil backed by brush.  "Do you think the horses can get down this bank?" "I think so. The deepest part of the river must be near this side, where it cuts into the bank. It's hard to tell how deep it is, or whether the horses will have to swim. It might be better if we would dismount and swim, too," Ayla said, then noticed that Jondalar seemed dis pleased, "but if it's not too deep, we can ride them across. I hate to get my clothes wet, but I don't feel like taking them off to swim across, either." They urged the horses over the precipitous edge. Hooves slipped and slid down the fine-grained soil of the bank and into the water with a splash as they were dunked in the fast current and carried down stream. It was deeper than Ayla had thought. The horses had a mo ment of panic before they got accustomed to their new element and started swimming against the current toward the sloping opposite shore. As they started up the gradual slope on the inner curve of the bend, Ayla looked for Wolf. Turning around, she saw him still on the high bank, whining and yelping, running back and forth.  "He's afraid to jump in," Jondalar said.  "Come, Wolf! Come on," Ayla called. "You can swim." But the young wolf whined plaintively and tucked his tail between his legs.  "What's wrong with him? He's crossed rivers before," Jondalar said, annoyed at another delay. He had hoped to travel a good distance that day, but everything seemed to be conspiring to stall them.  They had gotten off to a late start, then had been forced to double back toward the north and west, a direction he didn't want to go, and now Wolf wouldn't cross the river. He was also aware that they should stop and check the contents of the pack baskets, after their dunking, even if they were closely woven and essentially watertight. To add to his irritation, he was wet, and it was getting late. He could feel the wind cooling, and he knew they ought to change clothes and let the ones they were wearing dry. The summer days were warm enough, but the soughing night winds still brought the chill breath of the ice.  The effects of the massive glacier that crushed the northern lands under sheets of ice as high as mountains could be felt everywhere on earth, but nowhere as much as on the cold steppes near its edge.  If it were earlier, they could travel in wet clothes; the wind and sun Would dry them while they rode. He was tempted to start south any- way, just to get some distance behind them... if they could only get moving.  "This river is faster than he's used to, and he can't walk up to it. He has to jump in, and he's never done that before," Ayla said.  "What are you going to do?" "If I can't encourage him to jump, I'll have to go get him," she replied.  "Ayla, I'm sure if we just rode off, he'd jump in and follow you. If we're going to travel any distance at all today, we have to go." The withering look of disbelief and anger that appeared on her face made Jondalar wish he could take back his words. "Would you like to be left behind because you were afraid? He doesn't want to jump into the river because he hasn't done anything like it before. What can you expect?" "I just meant... he's only a wolf, Ayla. Wolves cross rivers all the time. He just needs some reason to jump in. If he didn't catch up with us, we'd come back for him. I didn't mean that we should leave him here." "You won't have to worry about coming back for him. I'll get him now," Ayla said, turning her back on the man and urging Whinney into the water.  The young wolf was still whining, sniffing the broken ground left by the horses' hooves, and looking at the people and the horses across the watery trench. Ayla called out to him again as the horse entered the current. About halfway across, Whinney felt the ground beneath her giving way. She whinnied with alarm, trying to find firmer footing.  "Wolf. Come here. Wolf! It's only water. Come on, Wolf! Jump in!" Ayla called out, trying to coax the apprehensive young animal into the swirling river. She slid off Whinney's back, deciding she would swim across to the steep bank. Wolf finally got up his courage and jumped in. He landed with a splash and started swimming toward her. "That's it! That's good, Wolf!" Whinney was backing around, struggling with her footing, and Ayla, with her arm around the wolf, was trying to reach her. Jondalar was already there, up to his chest in water, steadying the mare and starting toward Ayla. They all reached the other side together.  "We'd better hurry if we're going to travel any distance today," Ayla said, eyes still flashing anger as she started to remount the mare.  "No," Jondalar said, holding her back. "We're not leaving until you change out of those wet clothes. And I think we should rub down the horses to dry them off, and maybe that wolf, too. We've traveled far enough today. We can camp here tonight. It took me four years to get don't care if it takes four years to get back, just so I get you safely, Ayla." she looked up at him, the look of concern and love in his >lue eyes melted her last vestiges of anger. She reached for him bent his head to her, and she felt the same unbelievable won- iat she had felt the first time he put his lips on hers and showed /hat a kiss was, and an inexpressible joy in knowing that she ictually traveling with him, going home with him. She loved more than she knew how to express, even more now after the long ;er when she had thought he didn't love her and would leave with- lier.  llNI-'He had feared for her when she went back into the river and now he Illxessed her to him, holding her. He loved her more than he ever 'Alddieved it was possible for him to love anyone. Until Ayla, he didn't ^ViBnow he could love so much. He nearly lost her once. He had been ;Kure she was going to stay with the dark man with the laughing eyes, and he couldn't bear the thought that he might lose her again.  With two horses and a wolf for companions, in a world that had never before known they could be tamed, a man stood alone with the woman he loved in the middle of a vast, cold grassland, filled with a great abundance and diversity of animals, but few humans, and contemplated a Journey that would stretch across a continent. Yet there were times when the mere thought that any harm might come to her could overwhelm him with such fear, he almost couldn't breathe. At those moments, he wished he could hold her forever.  Jondalar felt the warmth of her body and her willing mouth on his, and he felt his need for her rise. But that would wait. She was cold and wet; she needed dry clothes and a fire. The edge of this river was as good a place as any to camp, and if it was a little too early to stop, well, it would give them time to dry out the clothes they were wearing, and they could start early tomorrow.    "Wolf. Put that down!" Ayla shouted, rushing to get the leather- wrapped package from the young animal. "I thought you had learned to stay away from leather." When she tried to take it away, he playfully hung on with his teeth, shaking his head back and forth and growling.  She let go, stopping the game. "Put it down!" she said sharply. She brought her hand down as though she meant to strike his nose but stopped short. At the signal and command, Wolf tucked his tail be- tween his legs, abjectly scooted toward her, and dropped the package at her feet, whining in appeasement.  That's the second time he's gotten into these things," Ayla said,  picking up the package and some others he had been chewing on. "He knows better, but he just can't seem to stay away from leather." Jondalar came to help her. "I don't know what to say. He drops it when you tell him, but you can't tell him if you're not there, and you can't watch him all the time... What's this? I don't remember seeing this before," he said, looking quizzically at a bundle that was carefully wrapped in a soft skin and securely tied.  Flushing slightly, Ayla quickly took the package from him. "It's.  just something I brought with me... something... from Lion Camp," she said, and she put it on the bottom of one of her pack baskets.  Her actions puzzled Jondalar. They had both limited their possessions and traveling gear to the minimum, taking little that was not essential. The package wasn't large, but it wasn't small either. She could probably have added another outfit in the space it took. What could she be taking with her?  "Wolf! Stop that!" Jondalar watched Ayla going after the young wolf again and had to smile. He wasn't sure, but it almost seemed that Wolf was purposely misbehaving, teasing Ayla to make her come after him, playing with her. He had found a camp shoe of hers, a soft moccasin-type of foot- covering that she sometimes wore for comfort after they made camp, particularly if the ground was frozen or damp and cold and she wanted to air out or dry her regular, sturdier footwear.  "I don't know what I'm going to do with him!" Ayla said, exasperated, as she came toward the man. She was holding the object of his latest escapade, and she looked sternly at the miscreant. Wolf was creeping toward her, seemingly contrite, whining in abject misery at her disapproval; but a hint of mischief lurked beneath his distress. He knew she loved him, and the moment she relented, he would be wriggling and yelping with delight and ready to play again.  Though he was adult size, except for some filling out. Wolf was hardly more than a puppy. He had been born in the winter, out of season, to a lone wolf whose mate had died. Wolfs coat was the usual gray-buff shade--the result of bands of white, red, brown, and black that colored each outer hair, creating the indistinct pattern that allowed wolves to fade invisibly into the natural wilderness landscape of brush, grass, earth, rock, and snow--but his mother had been black.  Her unusual coloring had incited the primary and other females of the pack into badgering her unmercifully, giving her the lowest status and eventually driving her away. She roamed alone, learning to survive in between pack territories for a season, until she finally found another loner, an old male who had left his pack because he couldn't keep up any more. They fared well together for a while. She was the stronger hunter, but he was experienced and they had even begun to define and defend a small piece of territory of their own. It might have been the better diet that two of them working together were able to secure, or the companionship and nearness of a friendly male, or her own genetic predisposition that brought her into heat out of season, but her elderly companion was not unhappy and, without competition, was both will ing and able to respond.  Sadly, his stiff old bones were not able to resist the ravages of an other harsh winter on the periglacial steppes. He did not last long into the cold season. It was a devastating loss for the black female, who was left to give birth alone—in winter. The natural environment does not tolerate very well animals with much deviation from the norm, and seasonal cycles enforce themselves. A black hunter in a landscape of tawny grass, dun earth, and windblown or drifted snow is too easily seen by canny and winter-scarce prey. With no mate or friendly aunts, uncles, cousins, and older siblings to help feed and care for the nursing mother and the new pups, the black female weakened, and one after another her babies succumbed until there was only one left.  Ay la knew wolves. She had observed and studied them from the time she first started hunting, but she had no way of knowing the black wolf who tried to steal the ermine she had killed with her sling was a starving, lactating female; it was the wrong season for pups. When she tried to retrieve her pelt and the wolf uncharacteristically attacked, she killed it in self-defense. Then she saw the animal's condition and real ized she must have been a loner. Feeling a strange kinship with a wolf she knew had been driven from its pack, Ayla was determined to find the motherless pups, who would have no family to adopt them. Fol lowing the wolfs trail back, she found the den, crawled in, and found the last pup, unweaned, eyes barely open. She took it with her to Lion Camp.  It had been a surprise to everyone when Ayla showed them the tiny wolf pup, but she had arrived with horses who answered to her. They had grown used to them and the woman who had an affinity for ani mals, and they were curious about the wolf and what she would do with it. That she was able to raise it and train it was a wonder to many.  Jondalar was still surprised at the intelligence the animal displayed; intelligence that seemed almost human.  "I think he's playing with you, Ayla," the man said.  She looked at Wolf and couldn't resist a smile, which brought his au "P and caused his tail to start thumping the ground in anticipa- tion. "I think you're right, but that isn't going to help me keep him from chewing on everything," she said, looking at the shredded camp shoe. "I might as well let him have this. He's ruined it already, and maybe he won't be so interested in the rest of our things for a while." She threw it at him, and he leaped up and caught it in the air with, Jondalar was almost sure, a wolfish grin.  "We'd better get packed up," he said, recalling that they hadn't traveled very far south the day before.  Ayla looked around, screening her eyes from the bright sun just beginning to climb the sky toward the east. Seeing Whinney and Racer in the grassy meadow beyond the brushy wooded lobe of land that the river curved around, she whistled a distinctive call, similar to the whistle she used to signal Wolf, but not the same. The dark yellow mare raised her head, whinnied, then galloped toward the woman. The young stallion followed her.  They broke camp, packed the horses, and were nearly ready to start out when Jondalar decided to rearrange the tent poles in one basket and his spears in another to balance out his load. Ayla was leaning against Whinney while she waited. It was a comfortable and familiar posture for both of them, a way of touching that had developed when the young filly was her only companion in the rich but lonely valley.  She had killed Whinney's mother, too. By then she had been hunting for years, but only with her sling. Ayla had taught herself to use the easily concealed hunting weapon, and she rationalized her breaking of Clan taboos by hunting primarily predators, who competed for the same food and sometimes stole meat from them. But the horse was the first large, meat-providing animal she had killed, and the first time she had used a spear to accomplish the deed.  In the Clan, it would have been counted as her first kill, if she had been a boy and allowed to hunt with a spear; as a female, if she used a spear, she would not have been allowed to live. But killing the horse had been necessary for her survival, though she did not select a nursing dam to be the one to fall into her pit-trap. When she first noticed the foal, she felt sorry for it, knowing it would die without its mother, yet the thought of raising it herself didn't occur to her. There was no reason why it should; no one had done it before.  But when hyenas went after the frightened baby horse, she remembered the hyena that had tried to drag off Oga's baby son. Ayla hated hyenas, perhaps because of the ordeal she'd had to face when she killed that one and exposed her secret. They were no worse than any other natural predator and scavenger, but to Ayla they had come to represent everything that was cruel, vicious, or wrong. Her reaction then was  spontaneous as it had been the other time, and the swift stones with a sling were just as effective. She killed one, drove the off and rescued the helpless young animal, but this time, in- >f an ordeal, she found company to relieve her loneliness, and die extraordinary relationship that developed.  i loved the young wolf as she would a bright and delightful but her feeling for the horse was of a different nature. Whinney shared her isolation; they had grown as close as any two such lilar creatures could. They knew each other, understood each trusted each other. The yellow mare was not merely a helpful 1 companion, or a pet, or even a well-loved child. Whinney had ler only companion for several years and was her friend.  But it had been a spontaneous, even irrational, act the first time Ay la climbed on her back and rode like the wind. The sheer excitement of it brought her back. In the beginning she did not purposely try to direct the horse, but they were so close that their understanding of each other grew with each ride.  While she waited forjondalar to finish, Ay la watched Wolf playfully chewing on her camp shoe and wished she could think of a way to control his destructive habit. Her eye casually noted the vegetation on the spit of land where they had camped. Caught between the high banks on the other side of the river as it curved around the sharp bend, the low land on this side flooded every year, leaving fertile loam to nourish a rich variety of brush, herbs, even small trees, and the rich pasture beyond. She always noticed the plants in her vicinity. It was second nature for her to be aware of everything that grew and, with a knowledge that was so ingrained it was almost instinctive, to catalogue and interpret it.  She saw a bearberry shrub, a dwarf evergreen heath plant with small, dark green, leathery leaves, and an abundance of small, round, pink-tinged white flowers that promised a rich crop of red berries.  Though sour and rather astringent, they tasted fine when they were cooked with other food, but more than food, Ayla knew the juice of the berry was good for relieving the burning sensation that could occur when passing water, especially if it was pinkish with blood.  Nearby was a horseradish plant with small white flowers clustered in a bunch on stems with small narrow leaves, and lower down, long, pointed, shiny dark green leaves, growing up from the ground. The root would be stout and rather long with a pungent aroma and a burn- "^ hot taste. In very small quantities, it was an interesting flavor with meats, but Ayla was more intrigued with its medicinal use as a stimu- ant tor the stomach, and for passing water, and as an application to  sore and swollen joints. She wondered if she should stop to collect some, and then decided that she probably shouldn't take the time.  But she reached for her pointed digging stick with no hesitation when she saw the antelope sage plant. The root was one of the ingre dients of her special morning tea, one she drank during her moon time when she bled. At other times she used different plants in her tea, particularly the golden thread that always grew on other plants and often killed them. Long ago Iza had told her about the magic plants that would make the spirit of her totem strong enough to defeat the spirit of any man's totem, so no baby would start growing inside her.  Iza had always warned her not to tell anyone, particularly a man.  Ay la wasn't sure if it was spirits that caused babies. She thought a man had more to do with it, but the secret plants worked anyway. No new life had started in her when she drank the special teas, whether she was near a man or not. Not that she would have minded, if they were settled in one place. But Jondalar had made it clear to her that with such a long Journey ahead of them, it would be a risk to get pregnant along the way.  As she pulled out the root of the antelope sage and shook the dirt off, she saw the heart-shaped leaves and long yellow tubular flowers of snakeroot, good for preventing miscarriage. With a twinge of sorrow, she remembered when Iza had gone to get that plant for her. When she stood up and went to put the fresh roots she had collected into a special basket that was attached near the top of one of the pack baskets, she saw Whinney selectively biting off the tops of wild oats. She liked the seeds, too, she thought, when they were cooked, and her mind, continuing its automatic medicinal cataloguing, added the information that the flowers and stalks aided digestion.  The horse had dropped dung, and she noticed flies buzzing around it. In certain seasons insects could be terrible, she thought, and decided she would watch for insect repellent plants. Who knew what kind of territory they would have to travel through?  In her offhand perusal of the local vegetation she noted a spiny bush that she knew was the variety of wormwood with the bitter taste and strong camphor smell, not an insect repellent, she thought, but it had its uses. Nearby were cranesbills, wild geraniums with leaves of many teeth and five-petaled reddish-pink flowers, that grew into fruits that resembled the bills of cranes. The dried and powdered leaves helped stop bleeding and heal wounds; made into a tea it healed mouth sores and rashes; and the roots were good for runny stools and other stomach problems. It tasted bitter and sharp, but was gentle enough for chil dren and old people. II Glancing around toward Jondalar, she noticed Wolf again, still .Irfiewing on ner shoe- suddenly she hopped her mental ruminations Ntfldfocused again on the last plants she had noted. Why had they S^Bwfat her attention? Something about them seemed important. Then ^^^^ne to her. She quickly reached for her digging stick and started ^iiwakine up the ground around the bitter-tasting wormwood with the '%KSfae smell of camphor, and then the sharp, astringent, but relatively harmless geranium.  Jondalar had mounted and was ready to go when he turned to her.  "Ayla why are you collecting plants? We should be leaving. Do you really need those now?" "Yes," she said, "I won't be long," going next after the long, thick horseradish root with the burning hot taste. "I think I know a way to fceep him away from our things," Ayla said, pointing at the young canine playfully gnawing on what was left of her leather camp shoe.  Tm going to make 'Wolf repellent.' " They headed southeast from their camping place to get back to the river they had been following. The windswept dust had settled overight, and in the stark, clear air the boundless sky revealed the distant reach of the horizon that had been obscured before. As they rode across country their entire view, from one edge of the earth to the other, north to south, east to west, undulating, billowing, constantly in morion, was grass; one vast, encompassing grassland. The few trees that existed near waterways only accentuated the dominant vegetation. But the magnitude of the grassy plains was more extensive than they knew.  Massive sheets of ice, two, three, up to five miles thick, smothered the ends of the earth and sprawled over the northern lands, crushing Ae stony crust of the continent and depressing the bedrock itself with its inconceivable weight. South of the ice were the steppes--cold, dry grassland as wide as the continent, marching from western ocean to eastern sea. All the land bordering the ice was an immense grassy plain. Everywhere, sweeping across the land, from lowland valley to windblown hill, there was grass. Mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas that provided enough moisture for trees were the only intrusions into we essential grassy character of the northern lands during the Ice Age.  Ayla and Jondalar felt the level ground begin sloping downhill toward the valley of the larger river, though they were still some distance from the water. Before long they found themselves surrounded by tall grass. Stretching to see over the eight-foot growth, even from Whin- oey's back, Ayla could see little more than Jondalar's head and shoulers between the feathery tops and the nodding stems of minuscule florets, turning gold with a faintly reddish tinge, atop the thin, blue- green stalks. She glimpsed his dark brown mount now and then, but recognized Racer only because she knew he was there. She was glad for the advantage of height the horses gave them. Had they been walking, she realized, it would have been like traveling through a dense forest of tall green grass waving in the wind.  The high grass was no barrier, parting easily in front of them as they rode, but they could see only a short distance past the nearest stalks, and behind them the grass sprang back, leaving little trace of the way they had come. Their view was limited to the area immediately around them, as though they took with them a pocket of their own space as they moved. With only the brilliant incandescence tracing its familiar path through the clear deep blue above, and the bending stalks to show the direction of the prevailing wind, it would have been more difficult to find their way, and very easy to become separated.  As she rode, she heard the soughing wind and the high whine of mosquitoes zinging by her ear. It was hot and close in the middle of the dense growth. Though she could see the tallgrass swaying, she barely felt a breath of wind. The buzz of flies and a whiff of fresh dung told her that Racer had recently dropped scat. Even if he hadn't been )ust a few paces ahead, she would have known it was the young stallion who had passed that way. His scent was as distinctively familiar to her as that of the horse she was riding--and her own. All around was the rich humus odor of the soil, and the green smell of burgeoning vegetation.  She did not classify smells as bad or good; she used her nose as she did her eyes and ears, with knowledgeable discrimination to help her investigate and analyze the perceptible world.  After a time, the sameness of the scenery, of long green stalk after long green stalk, the rhythmic gait of the horse, and the hot sun almost directly above, made Ayla lethargic; awake, but not fully aware. The repetitive tall, thin, pointed grass stems became a blur she no longer saw. Instead, she began to notice all the other vegetation. Much more than grass grew there, and as usual, she took mental note of it, without consciously thinking about it. It was simply the way she saw her environment.  There, Ayla thought, in that open space--some animal must have made that by rolling in it--those are goosefoots, what Nezzie called goosefoots, like the pigweed near the clan's cave. I should pick some, she mused, but made no effort to do so. That plant, with the yellow flowers and leaves wrapped around the stem, that's wild cabbage. That would be good to have tonight, too. She passed it by as well. Those purple-blue flowers, with the small leaves, that's milk vetch, and it has  I wonder if they're ready? Probably not. Up ahead, mat white flower, sort of rounded, pink in the middle, it's wild carrot.  oks like Racer stepped on some of the leaves. I should get my ne stick, but there's more over there. Seems to be a lot of it. I can and it's so hot. She tried to swat away a pair of flies that buzzed ad her sweat-damp hair. I haven't seen Wolf for a while. I wonder e he is?  je turned to look for the wolf and saw him following close behind mare, sniffing the ground. He stopped, lifting his head to catch her scent, then disappeared into the grass on her left. She saw a e blue dragonfly with spotted wings, disturbed by the wolfs pas- t through the dense living screen, hovering near the place he had i as though marking it. A short time later, a squawk and a whir of iliffsoas preceded the sudden appearance of a great bustard taking to the "lltO?. Ayla reached for her sling, wrapped around her head across her ^forehead. It was a handy place to keep it to get it quickly, and it kept her hair out of the way besides.  But the huge bustard--at twenty-five pounds the heaviest bird on die steppes--was a speedy flier for its size, and it was out of range before she got a stone out of her pouch. She watched the mottled bird with dark-tipped white wings building up speed, its head stretched forward, its legs backward, as it flew away, wishing she had known what Wolf had scented. The bustard would have made a wonderful meal for all three of them, with plenty left over.  "Too bad we weren't faster," Jondalar said.  Ayla noticed he was putting a light spear and his spear-thrower back in his pack basket. She nodded as she wrapped her leather sling back around her head. "I wish I had learned to use Brecie's throwing stick.  It's so much faster. When we stopped by that marsh where all the birds were nesting on the way to hunt mammoths, it was hard to believe how quick she was with it. And she could get more than one bird at a time." "She was good. But she probably practiced as long with that throwing stick as you did with your sling. I don't think that kind of skill is something to be gained in one season." "But if this grass wasn't so tall, I might have been able to see what Wolf was going after in time to get my sling and some stones out. I thought it was probably a vole." "We should keep our eyes open for anything else that Wolf might sca^ up," Jondalar said.  I had my eyes open. I just can't see anything!" Ayla said. She looked at the sky to check the position of the sun, and she stretched up  to try to see over the grass. "But you're right. It wouldn't hurt to think about getting fresh meat for tonight. I've seen all kinds of plants that are good to eat. I was going to stop and gather some, but they seem to be all over, and I'd rather do it later and have them fresh, not after they've wilted in this hot sun. We still have some of the bison roast left that we got from Feather Grass Camp, but it will only last one more meal, and there's no reason to use the dried traveling meat at this time of year, when there is plenty of fresh food around. How much longer before we stop?" "I don't think we're far from the river--it's getting cooler, and this high grass usually grows in lowlands around water. Once we reach it, we can start looking for a place to camp as we go downriver," Jondalar said, starting out again.  The stand of high grass extended all the way to the river's edge, though it was intermixed with trees near the damp bank. They stopped to let the horses drink, and they dismounted to quench their own thirst, using a small, tightly woven basket as a dipper and cup. Wolf soon darted out of the grass, noisily lapped up his own drink, then plopped down and watched Ayla, with his tongue hanging out, panting heavily.  Ayla smiled. "Wolf is hot, too. I think he has been exploring," she said. "I'd like to know all the things he's found out. He sees a lot more than we do in this high grass." "I'd like to get beyond it before we make camp. I'm used to seeing farther and this makes me feel closed in. I don't know what's out there, and I like knowing what's around me," Jondalar said, as he reached for his mount. Holding on to Racer's back just below his stiff, stand-up mane, with a strong jump the man threw a leg over and, bracing himself with his arms, landed lightly astride the sturdy stallion. He guided the horse away from the softened riverbank to firmer ground, before heading downriver.  The great steppes were by no means a single, huge, undifferentiated landscape of gracefully swaying stalks. Tallgrass grew in selected areas of ample moisture, which also contained a great diversity of other plants. Dominated by grasses more than five feet tall but ranging up to twelve feet in height--big bulbous bluestem, feather grasses, and tufted fescues--the colorful forb meadows added a variety of flowering and broad-leaved herbs: aster and coltsfoot; yellow, many-petaled elecampane and the big white horns of datura; groundnuts and wild carrots, turnips and cabbages; horseradish, mustard, and small onions; irises, lilies, and buttercups; currants and strawberries; red raspberries and black.  semiarid regions of little rainfall, shortgrasses, less than a foot Ehalftall, had evolved. They stayed close to the ground with most e growth underneath, and vigorously sent out new shoots, espe- in times of drought. They shared the land with brush, particu- iutemisias like wormwood and sage.  -tween those two extremes were the midgrasses, filling niches too (for shortgrass or too dry for tallgrass. Those meadows of moderate Igture could be colorful, too, with many flowering plants intermixed h the grassy ground cover of wild oats, foxtail barley, and, partic- Jly on slopes and uplands, little bluestems. Cordgrass grew where | land was wetter, needlegrass in cooler areas with poor, gravelly |b. There were many sedges, too--stalks were solid in sedges, tited where leaves grew out of the stems of grasses--including cotton ss, primarily in tundra and wetter ground. Marshes abounded with tphragmite reeds, cattails, and bulrushes.    ""' lit was cooler near the river, and as afternoon wore into evening, yla was feeling pulled two ways. She wanted to hurry and see an end (the stifling tallgrass, but she also wanted to stop and collect some of ie vegetables she was seeing along the way for their evening meal. A lythm began to develop to her tension; yes she would stop, no she Quid not, sounded over and over in her mind.  I Soon the rhythm itself overcame any meaning in the words, and a talent throbbing that felt as though it should have been loud filled her Jwith apprehension. It was disturbing, this sense of deep, loud sound jpfae could not quite hear. Her discomfort was emphasized by the tall- H^ass crowding in close all around her, which allowed her to see, but |g|0t quite far enough. She was more used to seeing long distances, far |j|ristas, to seeing, at least, beyond the immediate screen of grass stems.  j|:jAs they continued, the feeling became more acute, as though it was S. ipoming closer, or they were drawing nearer to the source of the silent ^^iound.  I ^t> ^yl3 noticed that the ground seemed freshly disturbed in several ^places, and she wrinkled her nose as she sniffed a strong, pungent, |S musky smell, trying to place it. Then she heard a low growl issue from |Wolfs throat.  '^ 'Jondalar!" she called out, and she saw that he had stopped and was ,; holding his hand up, signaling her to stop. There was definitely some- ™uig ahead. Suddenly, the air was split by a great, loud, blasting ^scream.    'olf! Stay here!" Ayla commanded the young animal, who was inching forward with curiosity. She slid off Whinney's back and moved to catch up with Jondalar, who had dismounted as well, and was cautiously moving through the thinning grass ahead toward the shrill screams and loud rumbles. She reached his side as he stopped, and they both parted the last tall stalks to see. Ayla bent down on one knee to hold Wolf as she looked, but she could not move her eyes away from the scene in the clearing.  An agitated herd of woolly mammoths was milling about--it had been their feeding that had created the clearing near the edge of the tallgrass region; a large mammoth required over six hundred pounds of feed every day, and a herd could strip a considerable area of vegetation quickly. The animals were all ages and sizes, including some that could not have been more than a few weeks old. That meant it was a herd of, primarily, related females: mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, and their offspring; an extended family led by a wise and canny old matriarch, who was noticeably larger.  At a quick glance, the overall color of the woolly mammoths was a reddish brown, but a closer look revealed many variations of the basic shade. Some were more red, some more brown, some tended toward yellow or gold, and a few looked almost black from a distance. The thick, double-layered coats covered them entirely, from their broad trunks and exceptionally small ears, to their stubby tails ending in dark tufts, and their stumpy legs and broad feet. The two layers of fur contributed to the differences in color.  Though much of the warm, dense, amazingly silky-soft underwool had been shed earlier in the summer, the next year's growth had already started, and was lighter in color than the fluffy, though coarser, wind-breaking overlay er, and gave it depth and highlights. The darker outer hairs, of varying lengths, some up to forty inches long, hung down like a skirt along the flanks, and quite thickly from the abdomen and dewlap--the loose skin of the neck and chest--creating a padding underneath them when they lay down on frozen ground.  i was entranced by a pair of young twins with beautiful reddish- fur accented by spiky black guard hairs, who peeked out from ...J the huge legs and long ochre skirt of their hovering mother.  dark brown hair of the old matriarch was shot with gray. She d as well, the white birds that were constant companions of the aoths, tolerated or ignored whether they sat on the top of a v head, or adroitly avoided a massive foot, while they feasted on -sects that the great beasts disturbed.  Volf whined his eagerness to investigate the interesting animals -X closely, but Ayla held him back, while Jondalar got the restrain- Jiope from Whinney's basket. The grizzled matriarch turned to look faeir direction for a long moment--they noticed that one of her long Hdcs was broken off--then she turned her attention back to more JuxMtant activity.  HOnly very young males stayed with the females, they usually left »e natal herd sometime after they reached puberty at about twelve, lit several young bachelors, and even a few older ones were included (this group. They had been drawn by a female with a deep chestnut- alored coat. She was in heat, and that was the cause of the commotion ILyla and Jondalar had heard. A female in heat, estrus, the reproduc- j|tfve period when females were able to conceive, was sexually attractive all males, sometimes more than she liked.  gft; The chestnut female had just rejoined her family group after out- te«Ustancing three young males in their twenties, who had been chasing 'ftaer. The males, who had given up, but only temporarily, were stand- %lng away from the close-packed herd resting, while she sought respite ij! from her exertions within the midst of the excited females. A two-year- y old calf rushed up to the object of the male's attention, was greeted by ? t gentle touch of a trunk, found one of the two breasts between her front legs and began to suckle, while the female reached for a trunkful <rf grass. She had been chased and harassed by the males all day, and had had little opportunity to feed her calf, or even to eat or drink herself. She was not to have much chance then.  A medium-size bull approached the herd and began touching the Other females with his trunk, well down from the tail between their ""id legs, smelling and tasting, to test their readiness. Since mammoths continued to grow all their lives, his size indicated he was older than the three who had been chasing the beleaguered female before, probably in his thirties. As he neared the chestnut-furred mammoth, she moved away at a fast walk. He immediately abandoned the others Ml" started after her. Ayla gasped when he released his huge organ "from its sheath and it started to swell into a long curving S-shape.  The young man beside her heard the sudden intake of breath and glanced at her. She turned to look at him, and their eyes, equally astonished and full of wonder, held for a moment. Although they had both hunted mammoths, neither of them had observed the great woolly beasts very often from so near, and neither had ever seen them mate.  Jondalar felt a quickening in his own loins as he watched Ay la. She was excited, flushed, her mouth slightly open, taking quick breaths, and her eyes, opened wide, held a sparkle of curiosity. Fascinated by the awesome spectacle of the two massive creatures about to show honor to the Great Earth Mother, as She required of all Her children, they quickly turned back.  But the female ran in a large arc, keeping ahead of the larger bull, until she made it back to her family herd again, though it made little difference. In a short time she was being chased again. One male caught up to her and managed to mount, but she was uncooperative and got out from under him, though he sprayed her hind legs. Sometimes her calf tried to follow the chestnut as she sped away from the bachelors several more times, before it finally decided to stay with the other females. Jondalar wondered why she was trying so hard to avoid the interested males. Didn't the Mother expect female mammoths to honor Her, too?  As though they had mutually decided to stop and eat, it was quiet for a while, with all the mammoths moving slowly south through the tallgrass tearing out trunkful after trunkful in a steady rhythm. In the rare moment of relief from the harassment of the males, the chestnut mammoth stood with her head low, looking very tired as she tried to feed.  Mammoths spent most of the day, and night, eating. Though it could be of the roughest, poorest quality--they could even eat shreds of bark torn off with tusks, though that was more often winter feed-- mammoths needed huge quantities of the fibrous fare to sustain them.  Included in the several hundred pounds of roughage consumed every day, which they passed through their bodies within twelve hours, was a small, though necessary, addition of succulent, broad-leaved, more nutritious plants, or occasionally a few choice leaves of willow, birch, or alder trees, higher in food value than the coarse tallgrass and sedge, but toxic to mammoths in large quantities.  When the great woolly beasts had moved some distance away, Ay la tied the restraining rope on the young wolf, who was if anything even more interested than they were. He kept wanting to get closer, but she didn't want him to disturb the herd or annoy them. Ay la felt the matriarch had given them leave to stay, but only if they kept their  se Leading the horses, who were exhibiting some nervousness dtement as well, they circled around through the tallgrass and d the herd. Though they had been watching for some time, Ayla nor Jondalar was inclined to leave yet. There was still a ^of anticipation lingering around the mammoths. Something was yw. Perhaps it was just that the mating they felt privileged, almost cd to observe, was still incomplete, but it seemed more than that.  i they slowly followed after the herd, they both studied the huge als closely, but each from a separate perspective. Ayla had been a -er from an early age, and had observed animals often, but her prey Ordinarily much smaller. Mammoths weren't usually hunted by sBviduals; they were hunted by large, organized, and coordinated mps. She had actually been closer to the great beasts before, when ; had gone to hunt them with the Mamutoi. But while hunting there S little time to watch and learn, and she didn't know when she would a- have the opportunity to get such a good look at them, both female 1 male, again.  ||y Though she was aware of their distinctive shape in profile, this time J||he took particular note of it. The head of a mammoth was massive ^|Hid high-domed--with large sinus cavities that helped to warm the ^Bearing cold winter air as it was breathed--accentuated by a hump of ^(at and a conspicuous topknot of stiff, dark hair. Just below the high 31 head was the deep indentation of the nape of its short neck, leading to [: a second hump of fat high on the withers above the shoulders. From ^ Acre, the back sloped steeply to the small pelvis and almost dainty hips. She knew from the experience of butchering and eating mam- ; moth meat that the fat of the second hump had a different quality from Ithat of the three-inch-thick layer of blubber that lay under the tough inch-thick skin. It was more delicate, tastier.  Woolly mammoths had relatively short legs for their size, making it somewhat easier for them to acquire their food, since they fed primarily on grass, not the high green leaves of trees as did their browsing warm-climate relatives; there were few trees on the steppes. But like : them, the mammoth's head was high up off the ground, and too big ^ and heavy, especially with enormous tusks, to be supported by a long ^ neck so that it could reach food or drink directly the way horses or j deer did. The evolution of the trunk had solved the problem of bring- ^ ing food and water to the mouth.  | The furry, sinuous snout of the woolly mammoth was strong enough to tear out a tree, or to pick up a heavy chunk of ice and send it crashing | ""wn to break into smaller, more usable pieces for water in winter, ( and dexterous enough to select and pluck a single leaf. It was also  marvelously adapted to pulling grass. It had two projections on the end of it. A fingerlike appendage on the upper part, which it could deli cately control, and a broader, flattened, very flexible structure on the lower part, almost like a hand, but without bones or separate fingers.  Jondalar was amazed at the dexterity and strength of the trunk as he watched a mammoth wrap the muscular lower projection around a bunch of closely growing tallgrass, then hold it together while the upper digit fingered more stems that were growing nearby into its clutch, until it had accumulated a good sheaf. Getting a grip by closing the upper finger around the bunch like an opposing thumb, the furry trunk yanked the grass out of the ground, roots and all. After shaking off some of the dirt, the mammoth stuffed it all in its mouth, and while it was chewing, reached for more.  The devastation that a herd left behind them as they made their long migrations across the steppes was considerable, or so it seemed. But for all the grass ripped out by its roots, and bark stripped from trees, their disturbance was beneficial to the steppes, and to other animals.  By clearing away the woody-stemmed tallgrass and small trees, a place was made for richer forbs and new grass to grow, food that was essen tial to several of the other inhabitants of the steppes.  Ayla suddenly shivered and felt a strange sensation deep in her bones. Then she noticed the mammoths had stopped eating. Several raised their heads and faced the south with their furry ears extended, moving their heads back and forth. Jondalar noticed a change in the dark red female, who had been chased by all the males. Her tired look was gone; she seemed, instead, to be anticipating. Suddenly she roared a deep, vibrating rumble. Ayla sensed a head-filling resonance, then felt the chill of gooseflesh as an answer, like the low growl of distant thunder, came from the southwest.  "Jondalar," Ayla said. "Look over there!" He looked where she had pointed. Rushing toward them, amidst a cloud of dust rising as if flung up by a whirlwind, only his domed head and shoulders visible above the tallgrass, was a huge, pale russet mam moth with fantastic and immense, upward-curving tusks. Where they started, side by side in the upper jaw, they were huge. They flared out as they grew downward, then they curved upward and spiraled in ward, slowly tapering to worn tips. Eventually, if he didn't break them, they would form a great circle with their tapered ends crossing in front.  The thick-furred Ice Age elephants were rather compact, seldom exceeding eleven feet at the shoulder, but their tusks grew to enormous size, the most spectacular of any of their kind. By the time a prime male mammoth reached the end of his seventy years, his great curved tofts of ivory could be a full sixteen feet in length, weighing two undred sixty pounds each.  A strong, acrid, musky odor arrived long before the russet bull did, aiding a wave of frenzied excitement through the females. When he ached the clearing, they ran toward him, giving him their scent with reat splashes of urine, squealing, trumpeting, and rumbling their reetings. They surrounded him, turning and backing up to him, or •ying to touch him with their trunks. They were attracted, but also perwhelmed. The males, however, retreated to the edge of the group.  When he was close enough for Ayla and Jondalar to get a good look t him, they, too, were awed. He held his great domed head high, isplaying his proud coils of ivory to best advantage. Far exceeding in sngth and diameter the smaller and straighter tusks of the females, his npressive tusks made even the more than respectable ivory of the large ulls seem puny. His small, thickly furred ears that were extended, is dark, stiff, erect topknot, and his light reddish-brown coat, long airs loose and flying in the wind, added fullness to his already massive iZe. Towering nearly two feet above the largest bulls, and twice the 'eight of the females, he was by far the most gigantic animal either of iem had ever seen. After surviving through hard times and good for lore than forty-five years, he was in peak condition, a dominant bull lammoth in his prime, and he was magnificent.  But it was more than the natural dominance of his size that had made ie other males back off. Ayla noticed that his temples were greatly ivollen and from midway between his eyes and ears, the rich russet ir of his cheeks was stained with black streaks by a musky, viscous uid that was constantly draining. He was also continuously dribbling nd occasionally gushing an acrid, strong-smelling urine, which coated ie fur on his legs and the sheath of his organ with a greenish scum.  he wondered if he was sick.  But the swollen temporal glands and other symptoms were not a ickness. Among woolly mammoths, not only did females come into eat, estrus, each year fully adult males went into lust, a period of eightened sexual readiness, called musth. Although a male mammoth iached puberty around twelve, he did not begin musth until he was lose to thirty, and then only for a week or so. But, by the time he iached his late forties, and was in his prime, if he was in top condi- on, he could be in musth for three or four months each year. Though ny male past puberty could mate with a receptive estrus female, bulls 'ere far more successful when they were in musth.  The big russet bull was not only dominant, he was in full rut and he ad come, in answer to her call, to mate with the female in heat.  At close range, male mammoths knew when females were ready to conceive by their scent, just as most four-legged male animals did. But mammoths ranged over such large territories that they had evolved an additional way to communicate that they were ready for mating. When a female was in estrus, or a male was in musth, the pitch of their voices lowered. Very low-pitched sounds do not die out across long distances the way higher tones do, and the deep rumbling calls that were made only then, carried for miles across the vast plains.  Jondalar and Ayla could hear the low rumbles of the estrus female clearly enough, but the male in musth had such quiet-seeming deep tones that they barely heard him. Even in ordinary circumstances, mammoths often communicated across distances with deep rumbles and calls that most people were not aware of. Yet the bull mammoth's musth calls were actually extremely loud, deep-voiced roars; the female estrus call was even louder. Though a few people could detect the sonic vibrations of the deep tones, most elements of the sounds were so low-pitched that they were below the range of human hearing.  The chestnut female had been holding off the bevy of younger bach elors, who had also been drawn by her attractive odors and by the sonorous rumbling of her low-pitched calls, which could be heard at a great distance by other mammoths, if not people. But she wanted an older, dominant male to sire her potential young, one whose years of living had already proved his health and survival instincts, and one she knew was virile enough to be a sire; in other words, one in musth. She didn't think about it in quite that way, but her body knew.  Now that he was here, she was ready. Her long fringe of hair sway ing with each step, the chestnut female ran toward the great bull, bellowing her sonorous rumbles and waving her furry little ears. She passed her water in a great splash, then, stretching her trunk toward his long, S-shaped organ, she sniffed and tasted his urine. Groaning thunderously, she pivoted around and backed into him, her head high.  The huge bull laid his trunk across her back, caressing and calming her; his huge organ nearly touched the ground. Then he reared up and mounted, placing his two front legs far forward on her back. He was nearly twice her size, so much larger that it seemed he would crush her, but most of his weight was carried on his hind legs. With the hooked end of his double-curved, marvelously mobile organ, he found her low-slung opening, then lifted up and penetrated deeply. He opened his mouth to bellow a roar.  The deep rumble that Jondalar heard sounded muted and far away, though he felt a throbbing sensation. Ayla heard the roar only slightly louder, but she shuddered violently as a shivering vibration tore through her. The chestnut mammoth and the russet bull held the position for a long moment. The long reddish strands of his full coat df hair shimmied over his whole body with the intensity and strain, though the movement was slight. Then he dismounted, gushing as he lyithdrew. She moved forward and uttered a low-toned and prolonged, pulsating bellow, which sent a powerful chill down Ayla's spine and pused gooseflesh.  H The whole herd ran to the dark red female, trumpeting and rumling, touching her mouth and her wet opening with their trunks, pefecating and splashing their water in an outburst of excitement. The Itusset bull seemed unaware of the joyful pandemonium as he stood (testing with his head down. Finally they calmed down and began ^wandering away to feed. Only her calf stayed nearby. The chestnut Ifemale rumbled deeply again, then rubbed her head against a russet Ishoulder.  ? None of the other males approached the herd with the big bull Inearby, though the chestnut was no less tempting. Besides lending imale mammoths irresistible charm, to females, musth also conferred 'dominance over males, making them very aggressive even toward those who were larger, unless they were also in that excited state. The other bulls shied away, knowing the russet would be easily irritated. Only another musth bull would try to face him, and only if he was close to the same size. Then, if they were both attracted by the same female, and found themselves in the vicinity of each other, they would invari- K ably fight, with severe injury or death a possible result.  §1 Almost as though they knew the consequences, they took great pains ||i to avoid each other and thus avoid fights. The deep-toned calls and the :H pungent urine trails of the musth male did more than announce his t| presence to eager females, they also announced his location to other ;t^ males. Only three or four other bulls were in musth at the same time, 1 during the six- or seven-month period that females might come into estrus, but it was unlikely that any of those who were also in lust would challenge the big russet for the female who was in heat. He was the dominant bull of the population, whether in musth or not, and they knew where he was.  As they continued to watch, Ay la noticed that even when the dark i^ed female and lighter-colored male began to feed, they stayed close together. At one point the female strayed a few feet away, reaching for a particularly succulent trunkful of herbs. One young bull, hardly ^re than an adolescent, tried to inch toward her, but as she ran back ner ronsort, the russet bull lunged at him, voicing his rumbling yowl. ing sharp, pungent scent and distinctive deep roar made their pression on the young male. He quickly ran away, then lowered his  head in deference and kept his distance. Finally, as long as she stayed near the musth bull, the chestnut female could rest and feed without being chased.  The woman and man could not quite bring themselves to leave immediately, though they knew it was over, and Jondalar was again beginning to feel the pressure of getting on their way. They felt awed, and honored, to have been included in witnessing the mating of the mammoths. More than merely having been allowed to observe, they felt a part of it, as though they had coined in on a moving and important ceremony. Ayla wished she could run up and touch them, too, to express her appreciation and share their joy.    Before they left, Ayla noticed that many of the plant foods she had seen all along the way were growing nearby, and she decided to gather some, using her digging stick for roots and a special knife, rather thick but strong, to cut stems and leaves. Jondalar got down beside her to help, though he had to ask her to point out exactly what she wanted.  It still surprised her. During the time they lived with the Lion Camp, she had learned the customs and patterns of work of the Mamutoi, which were different from the ways of the Clan. But even there, she often worked with Deegie or Nezzie, or many people worked together, and she had forgotten his willingness to do work that the men of the Clan would have considered the job of women. Yet, since the early days in her valley, Jondalar had never hesitated to do anything that she did, and he was surprised that she didn't expect him to share in the work that needed to be done. With just the two of them, she became aware of that side of him again.  When they finally did leave, they rode in silence for some time. Ayla kept thinking about the mammoths; could not get them out of her mind. She thought, too, about the Mamutoi, who had given her a home and a place to belong when she had no one. They called themselves the Mammoth Hunters, though they hunted many other kinds of animals, and gave the huge woolly beasts a unique place of honor, even while hunting them. Besides providing them with so much of what was necessary for existence--meat, fat, hides, wool for fibers and cordage, ivory for tools and carvings, bones for dwellings and even fuel --mammoth hunts had deep spiritual meaning to them.  She felt even more Mamutoi now, though she was leaving. It was not by chance, she felt, that they had come upon the herd when they did. She was sure there was a reason for it, and wondered if Mut, the Earth Mother, or maybe her totem, was trying to tell her something- She had found herself thinking often, lately, about the Great Cave i spirit that was the totem Creb had given her, wondering if he still ected her though she was no longer Clan, and where a Clan totem -nt would fit into her new life with Jondalar.  Irhe tallgrass finally began thinning out, and they moved closer to fc river looking for a place to camp. Jondalar glanced toward the sun Iscending in the west and decided it was too late to try to hunt that »ening. He wasn't sorry they had stayed to watch the mammoths, tt he had hoped to hunt for meat, not only for their meal that night, at to last for the next few days. He didn't want to have to use the ried traveling food they had with them unless they really needed it.  4ow they'd have to take the time in the morning.  | The valley with its luxuriant bottomland near the river had been langing, and the vegetation altered with it. As the banks of the swift aterway were rising in elevation, the character of the grass changed id, to Jondalar's relief, became shorter. It barely reached the bellies ? the horses. He preferred being able to see where they were going.  fhere the ground began to level out near the top of a slope, the ndscape took on a familiar feel. It wasn't that they had ever been in at particular locality before, but that it was similar to the region ound the Lion Camp, with high banks and eroded gullies leading to ae river.  They climbed a slight rise and Jondalar noticed that the course of |the river was veering to the left, toward the east. It was time to leave |this watery vein of life-supporting liquid meandering slowly toward l^fhe south and angle westward across country. He stopped to consult Ithe map Talut had carved on the slab of ivory for him. When he looked 'up, he noticed Ayla had dismounted and was standing on the edge of i the bank looking across the river. Something about the way she stood J made him think she was upset or unhappy.  i He shifted his leg over, got down from his mount, and joined her on the bank. Across the river he saw what had drawn her to the edge.  | Tucked into the slope on a terrace halfway up the opposite side was a j large, long mound with tufts of grass growing up the sides. It seemed to be a part of the riverbank itself, but the arched entrance closed by a heavy mammoth-hide drape revealed its actual nature. It was an earth- lodge like the one the Lion Camp called home, where they had lived during the previous winter.  As Ayla stared at the familiar-looking structure, she remembered vividly the inside of the Lion Camp's earthlodge. The roomy semisub- terranean dwelling was strong and built to last many years. The floor had been carved out of the fine loess soil of the riverbank and was below ground level. Its walls and rounded roof of sod covered with river clay were firmly supported by a structure of more than a ton of large mammoth bones, with deer antlers entwined and lashed together at the ceiling, and a thick thatch of grass and reeds between the bone and the sod. Benches of earth along the sides were made into warm beds, and storage areas were dug down to the cold permafrost level.  The archway was two large curved mammoth tusks, with the butt ends in the ground and the tips facing each other and joined. It was by no means a temporary construction, but a permanent settlement under one roof, large enough to support several large families. She was sure the makers of this earthlodge had every intention of returning, just as the Lion Camp did every winter.  "They must be at the Summer Meeting," Ayla said. "I wonder which Camp's home that is?" "Maybe it belongs to Feather Grass Camp," Jondalar suggested.  "Maybe," Ayla said, then stared in silence across the rushing stream.  "It looks so empty," she added after a while. "I didn't think when we left that I would never see Lion Camp again. I remember when I was sorting through things to take to the Meeting, I left some behind. If I'd known I wasn't going back, I might have taken them with me." "Are you sorry you left, Ayla?" Jondalar's concern showed, as always, in the worry wrinkles on his forehead. "I told you I would stay and become a Mamutoi, too, if you wanted me to. I know you found a home with them and were happy. It's not too late. We can still turn back." "No, I'm sad to be leaving, but I'm not sorry. I want to be with you.  That's what I've wanted from the beginning. And I know you want to go home, Jondalar. You have wanted to go back ever since I've known you. You might get used to living here, but you would never really be happy. You would always miss your people, your family, the ones you were born to. It's not as important to me. I will never know who I was born to. The Clan were my people." Ay la's thoughts turned inward, and Jondalar watched a gentle smile soften her face. "Iza would have been so happy for me if she could have known I was going with you. She would have liked you. She told me long before I left that I wasn't Clan, though I couldn't remember anyone or anything except living with them. Iza was my mother, the only one I knew, but she wanted me to leave the Clan. She was afraid for me. Before she died, she told me, 'Find your own people, find your own mate.' Not a man of the Clan, a man like me; someone I could love, who would care for me. But I was alone so long in the valley, I didn't think I ever would find anyone. And then you came. Iza was right. As hard as it was to leave, I needed to find my own people.  for Durc, I could almost thank Broud for forcing me to go. I Fnever have found a man to love me, if I hadn't left the Clan, or ^at I cared about so much." JTe aren't so different, Ayla. I didn't think I'd ever find anyone to Neither even though I knew many women among the Zeiandonii, hwe met many more on our Journey. Thonolan made friends easily, ftamone strangers, and he made it easy for me." He closed his eyes |n anguished moment, flinching from the memory, as a deep sor- iatouched his face. The pain was still sharp. Ayla could see it (never he talked about his brother.  Jhe looked at Jondalar, at his exceptionally tall, muscular body, at tkme straight, yellow hair tied back with a thong at the nape of his il at his fine, well-made features. After watching him at the Sum- Sr Meeting, she doubted that he needed his brother's help to make ends, especially with women, and she knew why. Even more than I build or his handsome face, it was his eyes, his startlingly vibrant d expressive eyes, which seemed to reveal the inner core of this very bate man, that gave him a magnetic appeal and a presence so com- Uing that he was nearly irresistible.  JiJust the way he was looking at her that moment, his eyes filled with "armth and desire. She could feel her body respond to the mere touch Fhis eyes. She thought of the chestnut mammoth, who kept refusing B the other males, waiting for the big russet bull to come, and then &t wanting to wait any more, but there was pleasure in prolonging ie anticipation, too.  She loved looking at him, filling herself with him. She thought he |llB!as beautiful the first time she saw him, though she had no one to ptompare him with. She had since learned that other women loved gitooking at him, too; considered him remarkably, even overwhelmingly iltttractive; and that it embarrassed him to be told about it. His outanding good looks had brought him at least as much pain as pleasure, p »nd to stand out for qualities that he had nothing to do with, did not jawing him the satisfaction of accomplishment. They were gifts of the Jg Mother, not the result of his own efforts.  j|^1 But the Great Earth Mother had not stopped with mere outward y^lPpearances. She had endowed him with a rich and lively intelligence, ijg^lhat tended more toward a sensitivity and understanding of the physi- "il~ ^P®^ or his world, and a natural dexterity. Abetted by training ^WMn the man to whom his mother had been mated when he was born, yho was acknowledged as the best in his field, Jondalar was a skilled ^ maker of stone tools who had honed his craft on his Journey by learn- ^iBg the techniques of other flint knappers.  For Ayla, though, he was beautiful not merely because he was exceptionally attractive by the standards of his people, but because he was the first person she could remember seeing who resembled her.  He was a man of the Others, not of the Clan. When he first came to her valley, she had studied his face minutely, if not obviously, even in his sleep. It was such a wonder to see a face with the familiar look of her own after so many years of being the only one who was different, who did not have heavy brow ridges and a sloped-back forehead, or a large, high-bridged, sharp nose, in a face that jutted out, and a jaw with no chin.  Like hers, Jondalar's forehead rose up steeply and smoothly, without heavy brow ridges. His nose, and even his teeth, were small by comparison, and he had a bony protuberance below his mouth, a chin, just as she did. After seeing him, she could understand why the Clan thought of her as having a flat face and bulging forehead. She had seen her own reflection in still water, and she believed what they had told her. In spite of the fact that Jondalar towered over her as much as she had towered over them, and that she had since been told by more than one man that she was beautiful, deep inside she still thought of herself as big and ugly.  But because Jondalar was male, with stronger features and angles more pronounced, to Ayla, he resembled the Clan more than she did.  They were the people she grew up with, they were her standard of measure, and unlike the rest of her kind, she thought they were quite handsome. Jondalar, with a face that was like hers, and yet more like a Clan face than hers, was beautiful.  Jondalar's high forehead smoothed as he smiled. "I'm glad you think she would have approved of me. I wish I could have met your Iza," he said, "and the rest of your Clan. But I had to meet you first or I would never have understood that they were people, and that I could meet them. The way you talk about the Clan, they must be good people. I'd like to meet one some time." "Many people are good people. The Clan took me in after the earthquake, when I was little. After Broud drove me away from the Clan, I had no one. I was Ayla of No People until the Lion Camp accepted me, gave me a place to belong, made me Ayla of the Mamutoi." "The Mamutoi and the Zeiandonii are not so different. I think you will like my people, and they will like you." "You haven't always been so sure of that," Ayla said. "I remember when you were afraid they would not want me, because I grew up with the Clan, and because of Durc." Jondalar felt a flush of embarrassment.  "They would call my son an abomination, a child born of mixed half-animal--you called him that, once--and because I birthed ^they would think even worse of me." sayia before we left the Summer Meeting, you made me promise tell you the truth, and not to keep things to myself. The truth is I was worried in the beginning. I wanted you to come with me, I didn't want you to tell people about yourself. I wanted you to -; your childhood, lie about it, even though I hate lies--and you rer learned how. I was afraid they would reject you. I know how it Heels and I didn't want you to be hurt that way. But I was afraid for Itnyself, too. I was afraid they would reject me for bringing you, and I didn't want to go through that kind of thing again. Yet I couldn't bear (o think of living without you. I didn't know what to do." Ayla remembered only too well her confusion and despair over his agony of indecision. As happy as she had been with the Mamutoi, she had also been miserably unhappy because ofjondalar.  "Now I know, though it took almost losing you before I realized it," Jondalar continued. "No one is more important to me than you, Ayla.  I want you to be yourself, to say or do whatever you think you should, because that's what I love about you, and I believe, now, that most people will welcome you. I've seen it happen. I learned something important from the Lion Camp and the Mamutoi. Not all people think alike and opinions can be changed. Some people will stand by you, sometimes those you least expect to, and some people have enough compassion to love and raise a child whom others call abomination." "I didn't like the way they treated Rydag at the Summer Meeting," Ayla said. "Some of them didn't even want to give him a proper burial." Jondalar heard the anger in her voice, but he could see tears threatening behind the anger.  , "I didn't like it either. Some people won't change. They won't open | their eyes and look at what is plain to see. It took me a long time. I |can't promise you that the Zeiandonii will accept you, Ayla, but if |they don't we'll find some other place. Yes, I want to return. I want to jgo back to my people, I want to see my family, my friends. I want to |tell my mother about Thonolan, and ask Zeiandoni to look for his spirit "I'm case he hasn't found his way to the next world yet. I hope we will |find a place there. But if not, it's not so important to me any more.  (That's the other thing I learned. That's why I told you I would be Willing to stay here with you, if you wanted me to. I meant it." J He was holding her with both his hands clasping her shoulders, jlooking into her eyes with fierce determination, wanting to be sure she ^Understood him. She saw his conviction, and his love, but now she Wondered if they should have left.  "If your people don't want us, where will we go?" He smiled at her. "We'll find another place, Ayla, if we have to, but I don't think we will. I told you, the Zeiandonii are not so different from the Mamutoi. They will love you, just as I do. I'm not even worried about it any more. I'm not sure why I ever was." Ayla smiled at him, pleased that he was so sure of his people's acceptance of her. She only wished she could share his confidence. He might have forgotten, or perhaps not realized, what a strong and lasting impression his first reaction to learning about her son and her background had made on her. He had jerked away and looked upon her with such disgust that she would never forget it. It was just as though she were some dirty, filthy hyena.  As they got under way again, Ayla kept thinking about what might await her at the end of her Journey. It was true, people could change.  Jondalar had changed completely. She knew there was not the least bit of that feeling of aversion left in him, but what about the people he had learned it from? If his response was so immediate, and so strong, his people must have taught it to him as he was growing up. Why should they react any differently to her than he had? As much as she wanted to be with Jondalar, and as glad as she was that he wanted to take her home with him, she was not altogether looking forward to meeting the Zeiandonii.  -.hey stayed close to the river as they continued on their way.  -ilar felt almost certain that the course of the stream was making a i toward the east, but he worried that it might only be a wide swing tits general meandering. If the waterway was changing direction, this lould be the place they would leave it--and the security of following B easily denned route--to strike out across country, and he wanted to lake sure they were in the right place.  There were several places they could have stopped for the night but, Misulting the map often, Jondalar was looking for a campsite that Falut had indicated. It was the landmark he needed to verify their ocation. The place was regularly used and he hoped he was right in Jthinking it was nearby, but the map showed only general directions and landmarks and was imprecise, at best. It had been quickly ^'Scratched onto the slab of ivory as an aid to the verbal explanations he ihad been given, and a reminder of them, and it was not meant to be an jaccurate representation of the route.  I When the bank continued to rise and pull back, they kept to the high ;ground for the wider view it offered, though it was drawing away (Somewhat from the river. Below, closer to the flowing water, an oxbow ilake was drying into a marsh. It had begun as a side loop of the river 'that swayed back and forth, as all flowing water did when traversing Open land. The loop eventually closed back on itself, and then filled in swith water to form a small lake, which became isolated when the river .changed course. With no source of water, it began to dry out. The ^sheltered lowland was now a wet meadow where marsh reeds and jCattails thrived, with water-loving bog plants filling its deep end. Over jtime, the green swale would become a grassy meadow enriched by this ^wetland stage.  I Jondalar almost reached for a spear when he saw a moose break out Mf the wooded cover near the edge and walk out into the water, but the |large deer was out of range, even with his spear-thrower, and it would S:oe difficult for them to retrieve it from the bog. Ayla watched the auigainly-seeming animal with the overhanging nose and large palmate  antlers, still in velvet, walking into the marsh. He lifted his long legs high, plopping his broad feet, which kept him from sinking into the mucky bottom, until the water reached his flanks. Then he submerged his head and came up with a mouthful of dripping duckweed and water bistort. Nearby waterfowl, nesting in the reeds, ignored his presence.  Beyond the marsh, well-drained slopes with gullies and cut banks offered protected crannies for forbs such as goosefoot, nettles, and mats of hairy-leaved, mouse-eared chickweed with small white flowers.  Ayla loosened her sling and took a few round stones from a pouch in readiness. At the far end of her valley there had been a similar location, where she had often observed and hunted the exceptionally large ground squirrels of the steppes. One or two could make a satisfying meal.  With the rugged terrain leading to open fields of grass, it was their favored habitat. The rich seeds from the nearby grasslands, stored safely in caches while the squirrels hibernated, sustained them in spring to breed so that at just the time new plants appeared, they would bear their young. The protein-rich forbs were essential for the young to reach maturity before winter. But no ground squirrels chose to show themselves while the people were passing, and Wolf seemed unable, or unwilling to flush them.  As they continued south, the great granite platform beneath the broad plain that stretched far to the east warped upward into rolling hills. Once, in ages long past, the land they were traveling over had been mountains that had long since worn down. Their stumps were a stubborn shield of rock that resisted the immense pressures that buckled land into new mountains, and the fiery inner forces that could shake and rend a less stable earth. Newer rock had formed on the ancient massif, but outcrops of the original mountains still pierced the sedimentary crust.  In the time when mammoths grazed the steppes, the grasses and herbs, like the animals of that ancient land, flourished not only in great abundance, but with a surprising range and diversity, and in unex pected associations. Unlike later grasslands, these steppes were not arranged in wide belts of certain limited kinds of vegetation, deter mined by temperature and climate. They were, instead, a complex mosaic with a richer diversity of plants, which included many varieties of grasses and prolific herbs and shrubs.  A well-watered valley, a highland meadow, a hilltop, or a slight dip in elevation, each invited its own community of plant life, which grew close beside complexes of unrelated vegetation. A slope facing south might harbor warm-climate growth, surprisingly different from the cold-adapted boreal vegetation on the north face of the same hill. brjie soil of the rugged upland Ayla and Jondalar were traversing IS poor, and the grass cover thin and short. The wind had eroded ^per gullies, and in the upper valley of an old spring-flood tributary, ^ riverbed had gone dry and, lacking vegetation, had drifted into id dunes.  Though later found only in high mountain reaches, in this rough rain not far from lowland rivers, singing voles and pikas were busily cans grass, to be dried and stored. Instead of hibernating in winter, ;y built tunnels and nests under the snowdrifts that accumulated in >s and hollows and on the lee side of rocks, and fed on their stored y. Wolf spied the small rodents and took out after them, but Ayla In't bother with her sling. They were too small to make a meal for ?ple, except in large numbers.  Arctic herbs, which did well in the wetter northern land of bogs i fens, benefited in spring from the additional moisture of the melt- ; drifts and grew, in an unusual association, alongside small hardy line shrubs on exposed outcrops and windswept hills. Arctic cinque- I, with small yellow flowers, found protection from the wind in the ne sheltered pockets and niches preferred by pikas, while on exposed faces, cushions of moss campion with purple or pink blossoms med their own protective hummocks of leafy stems in the cold fmg winds. Beside them, mountain avens clung to the rocky out- »ps and hills of this rugged lower land, just as it did on mountain- es, its low evergreen branches of tiny leaves and solitary yellow wers spreading out, over many years, into dense mats.  .noticed the fragrant scent of pink catchfly, just beginning to sn their blooms. It made her realize that it was getting late, and she need toward the sun lowering in the western sky to verify the hint " nose had detected. The sticky flowers opened at night, offering a /en to insects--moths and flies--in return for spreading pollen.  iey had little medicinal or food value, but the pleasant-smelling flow- pleased her, and she had a fleeting notion to pick some. But it was eady late in the day and she didn't want to stop. They ought to be king camp soon, she was thinking, particularly if she was going to he the meal she had been thinking about before it got dark.  She saw blue-purple pasqueflowers, erect and beautiful, each rising m expanding leaves covered with fine hairs and, unbidden, the med- 1 associations came into her mind--the dried plant was helpful for idaches and women's cramps--but she enjoyed it as much for its luty as for its usefulness. When her eye was caught by alpine asters ch long thin petals of yellow and violet growing from rosettes of Ey, hairy leaves, her fleeting notion became a conscious temptation gather a few, along with some of the other flowers, for no reason except to enjoy them. But where would she put them? They would only wilt, anyway, she thought.  Jondalar was beginning to wonder if they had missed the marked campsite, or if they were farther away from it than he had thought.  He was reluctantly coming to the conclusion that they were going to have to make camp soon and look for the landmark campsite tomorrow.  With that, and the need to hunt, they would probably lose another day, and he didn't think they could afford to lose so many days. He was deep in thought, still worrying about whether he had made the right decision in continuing south, and imagining the dire conse quences, and was not paying close attention to a commotion on a hill to their right, except for noticing that it seemed to be a pack of hyenas that had made a kill.  Though they often scavenged, and when hungry were satisfied with the most noxious of rotten carcasses, the large hyenas with their pow erful, bone-cracking jaws were also effective hunters. They had pulled down a yearling bison calf, nearly full-grown, but not fully developed.  His lack of experience with the ways of predators had been his undo ing. A few other bison were standing around, apparently safe now that one had succumbed, and one was watching the hyenas, bawling uneas ily at the smell of fresh blood.  Unlike mammoths, and steppe horses, which were not exceptionally large for their species, the bison were giants. The one nearby stood nearly seven feet at the withers and was heavily built in the chest and shoulders, though his flanks were almost graceful. His hooves were small, adapted to running very fast over firm dry soils, and he avoided bogs in which he would become mired. His large head was protected by massive long black horns, six feet across, that curved out and then up. His dark brown, hairy coat was heavy, especially in the chest and shoulders. Bison tended to face into the frigid winds and were better protected in front, where the hair fell in a fringe that was up to thirty inches long, but even his short tail was covered with hair.  Although they were all grass eaters, the various grazers did not eat precisely the same food. They had different digestive systems or dif ferent habits and made subtly different adaptations. The highly fibrous stems that sustained horses and mammoths were not sufficient for bison and other ruminants. They needed grass sheaths and leaves that were higher in protein, and bison preferred the low-growing, more nutritious shortgrass of the drier regions. They only ventured into the midgrass and tallgrass regions of the steppes in search of new growth, usually in spring when all the lands were rich with fresh grass and herbs—which was also the only time of the year when their bones and horns grew. The long, wet, green spring of the periglacial grassland, e t bison, and several other animals, a long season for growing, which "feed in'their heroic proportions.  his dark and introspective mood, it took a few moments for the Ibilities of the scene on the hill to make an impact on Jondalar. By trime he was reaching for his spear-thrower and a spear with the it'ofalso bringing down a bison, as the hyenas had, Ayla had already Ksed the situation, but had decided on a somewhat different course 'action.  ItHai! Hai! Get away from there! Go on, you filthy beasts! Get out 'here!" she shouted, galloping Whinney toward them, as she hurtled iBes with her sling. Wolf was beside her, looking pleased with him- Jf, as he growled and puppy-barked at the retreating pack.  k A few yelps of pain made it clear that Ayla's stones had reached ir mark, though she had held the force of her weapon in check and led for nonvital parts. If she had wished, her stones could have been ll; it wouldn't have been the first time that she had killed a hyena, : that had not been her intention.  I "What are you doing, Ayla?" Jondalar asked, riding toward her as pie was returning to the bison the hyenas had killed.  81 "I'm chasing those filthy, dirty hyenas away," she said, though it certainly must have been obvious.  1 "But why?" ^ "Because they are going to share that bison kill with us," she replied.  Is "I was just going after one of those that are standing around," Jondalar said.  ^ "We don't need a whole bison, unless we're going to dry the meat, id this one is young and tender. The ones that are standing around e mostly tough old bulls," she said as she slid off Whinney to chase ^olfaway from the downed animal.  | Jondalar looked more closely at the gigantic bulls, who had also jetreated from Ayla's hazing, and then at the young one on the ground.  ^You're right. This is a male herd, and that one probably left his toother's herd recently and just joined this male group. He still had a rttoleam." "It's a fresh kill," Ayla announced, after she examined it. "They've only torn out the throat, and the gut, so far, and a little of the flank.  We can take what we want, and leave the rest for them. Then we won't Ged to take the time to hunt down one of those others. They can run ^i and they might get away. I think I saw a place down by the river W- may have been a camp. If it's the one we're looking for, there's Ml time for me to make something nice tonight with all the food we Sthered and this meat." She was already cutting through the skin up from the stomach to the flank before Jondalar really grasped all that she had said. It had happened so fast, but suddenly all his concerns about losing an extra day because of having to hunt and look for the camp were gone.  "Ayla, you're wonderful!" he said, smiling as he dismounted from the young stallion. He pulled a sharp flint knife, that was hafted to a handle of ivory, out of a stiff rawhide sheath attached to his waist thong, and went to help butcher out the parts they wanted. "That's what I love about you. You're always full of surprises that rum out to be good ideas. Let's get the tongue, too. Too bad they already got to the liver, but after all, it is their kill." "I don't care if it is theirs," Ayla said, "so long as it's a fresh kill.  They've taken enough from me. I don't mind taking something back from those nasty animals. I hate hyenas!" "You really do, don't you? I never hear you talk that way about other animals, not even wolverines, and they scavenge rotten meat sometimes and are more vicious and smell worse." The hyena pack had been edging back toward the bison they had expected to feast on, snarling their displeasure. Ayla flung a few more stones to drive them back again. One of them whooped, then several cackled a loud laugh that made her skin crawl. By the time the hyenas decided to chance her sling once more, Ayla and Jondalar had gotten what they wanted.  They rode off, heading down a gully toward the river, with Ayla leading the way, leaving the rest of the carcass behind with the snarling beasts, who had immediately returned and begun to tear it apart again.  The signs she had seen were not of the camp itself, but a marker cairn pointing the way. Inside the heaped-up pile of stones were some dry emergency rations, a few tools and other implements, a fire drill and platform with some dry tinder, and a rather stiff fur with patches of hair falling out. It would still offer some protection from the cold, but it needed to be replaced. Near the top of the caim, firmly anchored by heavy stones, was the broken-off end of a mammoth tusk with its tip aiming toward a large boulder partly submerged in the middle of the river. On it a horizontal diamond shape was painted in red, with the V-shaped angle at the right end repeated twice, forming a chevron pattern pointing downstream.  After putting everything back exactly as they found it, they followed the river until they came to a second caim with a small tusk pointing inland toward a pleasant glade set back from the river, surrounded by birch and alder trees, with a few pines. They could see a third cairn, and when they reached it, they found beside it a small spring of fresh, pure sparkling water. There were also emergency rations and imple'  its inside this pile of stones, and a large leather tarp, also stiff, but ch could be made into a tent or a lean-to. Behind the caim, near a Ie of stones that outlined a shallow pit black with charcoal, was a of deadfall and driftwood that had been gathered.  This is a good place to know about," Jondalar said. "I'm glad we i't have to use any of the supplies, but if I lived in this region and to use it, I'd be relieved to know this is here." It is a good idea," Ayla said, marveling at the foresight of those o had planned and set up the campsite.  Fhey quickly removed the pack baskets and halters from the horses, ing the thongs and heavy cords that held them on, and set the dials loose to graze and relax. Smiling, they watched as Racer im- diately got down on the grass and rolled on his back, as though he I an itch he couldn't wait to scratch.  I'm feeling hot and itchy, too," Ayla said, untying the thongs und the soft tops of her footwear and kicking them off. She loosened belt, which held a knife sheath and pouches, took off a necklace of ry beads with a decorated pouch attached, and pulled off her tunic I leggings, then raced for the water with Wolf bounding beside her.  re you coming?" 'Later," Jondalar said. "I'd rather wait until after I get the wood, so on't take dirt and bark dust to bed with me." Ayla returned soon, changed into a different tunic and leggings that ; wore in the evenings, but put her belt and necklace back on.  idalar had unpacked, and she joined him in setting up their camp.  ley had already developed a pattern of working together that needed de decision making. They both put up the tent, spreading out an al ground cloth, then anchoring slender wooden shafts in the earth support a shaped leather tarp made of several hides sewn together.  ie conical tent had rounded sides and an opening at the top to let loke out if they needed to make a fire inside, though they seldom : d, and an extra flap sewn on the inside with which to close the smoke c »le against the weather, if they wished. t: Cords were f^tened around the bottom of the tent to tie it down to ,-gs pounded in the ground. In case of strong winds, the ground cloth 1 >uld be tied to the cover tarp with additional ropes, and the entrance v ip could ^e "^"cd down securely. They carried a second tarp with iem to i"3^ a ^w-insulated double-walled tent, though they'd as ;, rt had little ""^ion to use it.  They spr^0^ their sleeping furs, laying them out the long way y f the ov31' whlch left just enough room to fit their pack baskets and 1.  ^er bel^W W1ag the sides, and Wolf at their feet if the weather II ;1 was bad. They had begun with two separate sleeping rolls, but they had quickly managed to combine them so they could sleep together Once the tent was up, Jondalar went to gather more firewood, to replace whatever they would use, while Ay la began to prepare food.  Though she knew how to start a fire with the fire-making kit in the caim, by twirling the long stick between her palms against the flat platform of wood to make a coal that could be blown into a flame Ayla's fire-making kit was unique. While living alone in her valley, she had made a discovery. She had accidentally picked up a piece of iron pyrite from the litter of stones beside the stream, instead of the ham- merstone she was using to make new tools for herself from flint. But she had made fires often, and she understood the implications quickly when striking the iron pyrite and flint together created a long-lived spark that burned her leg.  It took several trials at first, but she had long since worked out the best way to use the firestone. Now she could make fire more quickly than anyone with a fire-drill and hearth, and hard concentrated effort, could even imagine. The first time Jondalar had seen it, he couldn't believe it, and the sheer wonder of it had contributed to her being accepted by the Lion Camp when Talut wanted them to adopt her.  They thought she had done it with magic.  Ayla thought it was magic, too, but she believed the magic was in the firestone, not in her. Before they left her valley for the last time, she and Jondalar had collected as many of the grayish-yellow metallic stones as they could, not knowing if they would ever find them in any other place. They had given some to the Lion Camp and other Ma- mutoi, but still had many left. Jondalar wanted to share them with his people. The ability to make a fire quickly could be extremely useful, for many purposes.  Inside the ring of stones, the young woman made a small pile of very dry bark shavings and the fuzz from fireweed as tinder, and laid beside it another pile of twigs and smallwood for kindling. Nearby was some of the dry deadfall from the woodpile. Getting down very close to the tinder, Ayla held a piece of iron pyrite at an angle that she knew from experience would work best, then struck the magical yellowish stone, down the middle of a groove that was forming from use, with a piece of flint. A large, bright, long-lived spark flew from the stone and landed on the tinder, sending a wisp of smoke into the air. Quickly she put her hand around it and blew gently. A small coal glowed with a red light and a shower of tiny sun-yellow sparks. A second breath produced a small flame. She added twigs, and smallwood, and when i1 was going well, a stick of deadfall. rime Jondalar returned, Ay la had several roundish stones, from a dry wash near the river, heating in the fire for cooking, , chunk of bison spitted over the flames, the outer layer of fat She had washed and was cutting up cattail roots, and another l^tarchy root with dark brown skin called groundnuts, preparing fc them in a tightly woven waterproof basket half-full of water, in l d^e fat-rich tongue was waiting. Beside it was a small pile of c wild carrots. The tall man put down his load of wood.  smells good already!" he said. "What are you making?" m roasting the bison, but that's mostly for traveling. It's easy to >ld roast along the way. For tonight, and tomorrow morning, I'm ae soup with the tongue and vegetables, and the little bit we have '•am Feather Grass Camp," she said.  ;th a stick, she fished a hot stone from the fire and brushed the off with a leafy twig. Then, picking up a second stick and using as tongs, she lifted the stone and dropped it in the basket with fiter and the tongue. It sizzled and steamed as it transferred its to the water. Quickly she dropped several more stones in the t pot, added some leaves she had cut up, and put on a lid.  Tiat are you putting in the soup?" •la smiled to herself. He always like to know the details of her ng, even the herbs that she used for making tea. It was another of tie traits that had surprised her because no man of the Clan would dream of showing so much interest, even if he might have been us, in anything that was in the memories of the women.  esides these roots, I'm going to add the green tops of the cattails, nibs, leaves, and flowers of these green onions, slices of peeled e stalks, the peas from milk vetch pods, and I just put in some md thyme leaves, for flavor. And maybe I'll put some coltsfoot in ause it has a kind of salty taste. If we're going near Beran Sea, >e we can get some more salt. We had it all the time when I lived the Clan," she mentioned. "I think I'll mash up some of that radish I found this morning, for the roast. I just learned about it the Summer Meeting. It's hot, and you don't need much, but it the meat an interesting taste. You might like it." Tiat are those leaves for?" he asked, indicating a bunch she had d but not mentioned. He liked to know what she used and how lought about food. He enjoyed her cooking, but it was unusual.  e were some tastes and flavors that were unique to her methods, lot like the tastes of foods he had grown up with.  his is goosefoot, to wrap the roast in when I put it away. They X)d together when they're cold." She paused, looking thoughtful. "Maybe I'll sprinkle some wood ashes on the roast; they taste a little salty, too. And I might add some of the roast to the soup after it browns, for color, and taste. With the tongue and the roast, it should be a good rich broth, and for tomorrow morning, it will be nice to cook up some of the grain we brought with us. There will be tongue left too, but I'll wrap it in dried grass and put it in my meat-keeper for later. There's room, even with the rest of our raw meat, including the piece we took for Wolf. As long as it stays cold at night, it should all keep fora while." "It sounds delicious. I can hardly wait," Jondalar said, smiling with anticipation, and something more, Ayla thought. "By the way, do you have an extra basket I can use?" "Yes, but why?" "I'll tell you when I get back," he said, grinning with his secret.  Ayla turned the roast, then removed the stones and added more hot ones to the soup. While the food was cooking, she sorted through the herbs she had gathered for "Wolf repellent," putting aside the plant she had gathered for her own uses. She mashed up some of the horseradish root in a bit of broth for their meal, then began mashing the rest of the hot root and bruising the other harsh, sharp, strong-smelling herbs she had gathered that morning, trying to develop the most noxious combination of the plants that she could imagine. She thought the hot horseradish would be the most effective, but the strong camphor smell of the artemisia could be very helpful, too.  But the plant she had put aside occupied her thoughts. I'm glad I found it, she was thinking. I know I don't have enough of the herbs I need for my morning tea to last for the whole Journey. I'm going to have to find more along the way to make sure I don't have a baby, especially being with Jondalar so much. She smiled at the thought.  I'm sure that's how babies get started, no matter what people say about spirits. I think that's why men want to put their organs in that place where babies come from, and why women want them to. And why the Mother made that Her Gift of Pleasure. The Gift of Life is from Her, too, and She wants Her children to enjoy making new life, especially since giving birth is not easy. Women might not want to give birth if the Mother hadn't made the starting of them Her Gift o1 Pleasure. Babies are wonderful, but you don't know how wonderful until you have one. Ayla had been privately developing her unorthodox ideas about the conception of life during the winter as she had been learning about Mut, the Great Earth Mother, from Mamut, the old teacher of the Lion Camp, though the original idea had occurred long before.  lit Broud wasn't a pleasure for me, she recalled. I hated it when he sd roe, but now I'm sure that's how Durc got started. No one ved I would ever have a baby. They thought my Cave Lion totem too strong for any man's totem spirit to overcome. It surprised yone. But it only happened after Broud began forcing me, and I d see his look in my baby. He had to be the one that started Durc yine inside me. My totem knew how much I wanted a baby of my (.-maybe the Mother did, too. Maybe that was the only way.  nut said the way we know Pleasures are a Gift from the Mother is they are so powerful. It's very hard to resist them. He said it is l harder for men than for women.  hat's the way it was with that dark red mammoth. All the males ted her, but she didn't want them. She wanted to wait for her big .Is that why Broud wouldn't let me alone? Even though he hated the Mother's Gift of Pleasure was more powerful than his hatred?  laybe, but I don't think he was doing it only for the Pleasures. He d get that from his own mate, or any woman he wanted. I think new how much I hated it and that made his Pleasure more. Broud ' have started a baby in me--or maybe my Cave Lion let himself lefeated because he knew how much I wanted one--but Broud d only give me his organ. He couldn't give me the Mother's Gift leasures. Only Jondalar did that.  here must be more to Her Gift than just the Pleasures. If She just ted to give Her children a Gift of Pleasure, why would She put it iat place, where children are born from? A place of Pleasures could mywhere. Mine aren't exactly where Jondalar's are. His Pleasure es when he is inside me, but mine is at that other place. When he s me Pleasure there, everything feels wonderful, inside and all '. Then I want to feel him inside me. I would not want to have my e of Pleasure inside. When I'm very sensitive, Jondalar has to be ' gentle, or it can hurt, and giving birth is not gentle. If a woman's e of Pleasure was inside, it would make giving birth much harder, rt's difficult enough as it is.  tow does Jondalar always know just what to do? He knew how to me Pleasures before I knew what they were. I think that big Mnoth knew how to give that pretty red one Pleasures, too. I think made that loud deep sound because he made her feel them, and s why all her family was so happy for her. Ayla's thoughts were ^Og tingling sensations and a warming glow. She glanced toward Wooded area where Jondalar had gone, wondering when he'd be L.    ut a baby doesn't start every time Pleasures are shared. Maybe  spirits are necessary, too. Whether it's the totem spirits of the Clan men, or the essence of a man's spirit that the Mother takes and gives tn a woman, it still starts when a man puts his organ inside and leaves hi essence there. That's how She gives a child to a woman, not with spirits, with Her Gift of Pleasure. But She decides which man's essence will start the new life, and when the life will begin.  If the Mother decides, why does Iza's medicine keep a woman from getting pregnant? Perhaps it won't let a man's essence, or his spirit mix with a woman's. Iza didn't know why it worked, but it does seem to, most of the time.  I would like to let a baby start when Jondalar shares Pleasures with me. I want to have a baby so much, one that's a part of him. His essence or his spirit. But he's right. We should wait. It was so hard for me to have Durc. If Iza hadn't been there, what would I have done?  I'd want to be sure there were people around who would know how to help.  I will keep drinking Iza's tea every morning, and I won't say anything.  She was right. I shouldn't talk too much about babies starting from a man's organ, either. It made Jondalar so worried when I mentioned it, he thought we'd have to stop having Pleasures. If I can't have a baby yet, at least, I want to have Pleasures with him.  Like those mammoths were having. Is that what that big mammoth was doing? Making a baby start in that dark red one. That was so wonderful, sharing their Pleasures with the herd. I'm so glad we stayed. I kept wondering why she was running away from all those others, but she wasn't interested in them. She wanted to choose her own mate, not go with anyone who wanted her. She was waiting for that big light brown bull, and as soon as he came, she knew he was the one. She couldn't wait, she ran right to him. She had waited long enough. I know how she feels.  Wolf loped into the clearing, proudly holding up an old rotting bone for her to see. He dropped it at her feet and looked up expectantly.  "Whew! That smells rotten! Where did you get that. Wolf? You must have found where someone's leavings were buried. I know you love rotten. Maybe this is a good time to see how you like hot and strong,' she said. She picked up the bone and spread some of the mixture she had been making on Wolfs prize. Then she threw it into the middle of the clearing.  The young animal eagerly dashed after it, but he sniffed it warily before he picked it up. It still had the wonderful rotten odor he adored, but he wasn't sure about that other strange smell. Finally he snatched it with his mouth. But very quickly he dropped it and began snorting  luffling and shaking his head. Ayla couldn't help it. His antics o funny that she laughed out loud. Wolf sniffed the bone again, acked off and snorted, looking very displeased, and ran toward ring.  u don't like that, do you, Wolf? Good! You're not supposed to " she said, feeling the laughter bubbling up inside her as she ed. Lapping water didn't seem to help much. He lifted a paw ibbed it down the side of his face, trying to wipe his muzzle, as l he thought that would get rid of the taste. He was still snorting iffing and shaking his head as he ran into the woods.  ialar crossed his path, and when he reached the glade he found aughing so hard there were tears in her eyes. "What is so funny?" ed.  u should have seen him," she said, still chortling. "Poor Wolf, s so proud of that rotten old bone he found. He didn't know lappened to it, and he tried everything to get the taste out of his i. If you think you can stand the smell of horseradish and cam- Jondalar, I think I've found a way to keep Wolf away from our ." She held out the wooden bowl she had been using to mix the ients. "Here it is. 'Wolf repellent!' " i glad it works," Jondalar said. He was smiling, too, but the glee lied his eyes wasn't caused by Wolf. Ayla finally noticed that his were behind his back.  tiat have you got behind your back?" she asked, suddenly is.  ;U, it just happens that when I was out looking for wood I found liing else. And if you promise to be good, I just might give you me what?" brought the filled basket in front of him. "Big, juicy, red rasp- s!" a's eyes lit up. "Oh, I love raspberries." m't you think I know it? What do I get for them?" he asked with Me in his eye.  a looked up at him and, walking toward him, smiled, a big fill wide smile that filled her eyes and beamed her love for him, ie warmth she had been feeling, and her delight because he d to give her a surprise.  ^nk I just got it," he said, letting out the breath he realized he'd lolding. "Oh, Mother, you are beautiful when you smile. You're fill all the time, but especially when you smile." "enly he was consciously aware of her, aware of every feature  and detail. Her long, thick, dark blond hair, gleaming with highlights where the sun had lightened it, was held back out of her way with a thong. But it had a natural wave and loose strands that had escaped the leather binding curled around her tanned face; one fell down her fore, head in front of her eyes. He restrained an urge to reach out and move it aside.  She was tall, a good match for his own six-foot, six-inch frame, and the lithe, flat, wiry muscles of real physical strength were sharply denned in her long arms and legs. She was one of the strongest women he'd ever met; as physically powerful as many men he knew. The people who had raised her were endowed with an appreciably greater bodily strength than the taller but lighter-weight people she was born to, and though Ayla was not considered particularly strong when she lived with the Clan, she had developed a far greater strength than she normally might have, just to keep up. Coupled with years of observing, tracking, and stalking as a hunter, she used her body with ease and moved with uncommon grace.  The sleeveless leather tunic she wore, belted, over leather leggings fit comfortably, but did not hide her firm, full breasts, which could have seemed heavy but didn't, or her womanly hips that curved back to her well-rounded and firm rear. The laces at the bottom of her leggings were open and she was barefoot. Around her neck was a small, beautifully embroidered and decorated leather pouch, with crane feathers along the bottom, which showed the bumps of the mysterious objects it held.  Hanging from the belt was a knife sheath made of stiff rawhide, the hide of an animal that had been cleaned and scraped but not processed in any way, so that it dried hard in whatever shape it was formed, though a good, thorough wetting could soften it again. She had tucked her sling into the right side of her belt, next to a pouch that held several stones. On the left side was a rather strange, pouchlike object. Though old and worn, it was obvious that it had been made from a whole otter skin, cured with the feet, tail, and head left on. The throat had been cut and the insides removed through the neck, then a cord was strung through slits and pulled tight to close. The flattened head became the flap. It was her medicine bag, the one she had brought with her fr010 the Clan, the one Iza had given her.  She does not have the face of a Zeiandonii woman, Jondalar w3- thinking; they would notice a foreign look, but her beauty was unnii5' takable. Her large eyes were gray-blue—the color of fine flii11' thought—and wide-spaced, outlined with lashes a shade or two dar^ than her hair; her eyebrows were somewhat lighter, between the oy in color. Her face was heart-shaped, rather wide with high cheekboP^' jaw and a narrow chin. Her nose was straight and finely her full lips» curving up at the corners, were opened and If showing her teeth in a smile that lit up her eyes and her sheer pleasure in the very act of smiling.  her smiles and laughter had once singled her out as differ- caused her to restrain them, Jondalar loved it when she and her delight in his laughter, joking, and playfulness magi- flsfonned the already pleasing arrangement of her features; she leyen more beautiful when she smiled. He suddenly felt over timed by the sight of her and his love for her, and silently thanked iMother again for giving her back to him.  IWhat do you want me to give you for the raspberries?" Ayla said.  |]1 me, and it's yours." il want you, Ayla," he said, his voice suddenly ragged with feeling.  tput the basket down, and in an instant he had her in his arms, King her with fierce emotion. "I love you. I don't ever want to lose H," he said in a hoarse whisper, kissing her again.  A. heady warmth rushed through her and she responded with a ling as strong. "I love you, too," she said, "and I want you, but can lush the meat away from the fire first? I don't want it to bum while >'re... busy." fondalar looked at her for a moment as though he hadn't understood | words; then he relaxed, gave her a hug, and backed off a step, iling ruefully. "I didn't mean to be so insistent. It's just that I love a so much, sometimes it's hard to hold. We can wait until later." She was still feeling her warm, tingling response to his ardor and Isn't sure she was ready to stop, now. She regretted, a little, her iunent that had interrupted the moment. "I don't have to put the tt away," she said.  ondalar laughed. "Ayla, you are an unbelievable woman," he said, ing his head and smiling. "Do you have any idea how remarkable are? You're always ready for me, any time I want you. You always ; been. Not just willing to go along, whether you feel like it or not, right there, ready to interrupt anything, if that's what I want." 'ut, I want you, whenever you want me." fou don't know how unusual that is. Most women want some ing, and if they're in the middle of doing something, most are not ag to be interrupted." Tie women I grew up with were always ready whenever a man ;her the signal. You gave me your signal, you kissed me and let now you wanted me." laybe I'll be sorry I said this, but you can refuse, you know." His lead wrinkled with the effort of trying to explain. "I hope you don't think you have to be ready every time I am. You aren't livin with the Clan any more." - "You don't understand," Ayla said, shaking her head, trying just a hard to make him understand. "I don't think I have to be ready. When you give me your signal, I am ready. Maybe it's because that's how women of the Clan always behaved. Maybe it's because you were the one who taught me how wonderful it is to share Pleasures. Maybe it because I love you so much, but when you give me your signal, I don't think about it, I feel it inside. Your signal, your kiss that tells me you want me, makes me want you." He was smiling again, with relief and pleasure. "You make me ready, too. Just looking at you." He bent his head to her, and she reached up to him, molding herself against him as he pressed her tight.  He restrained the impetuous eagerness he felt, though an extraneous feeling of pleasure that he could still feel so eager for her crossed his mind. Some women he'd tired of after a single experience, but with Ayla it always seemed new. He could feel her firm strong body against his, and her arms around his neck. He slid his hands forward and held the sides of her breasts as he bent farther to kiss the curve of her neck.  Ayla removed her arms from around his neck and began to untie her belt, dropping it and all the implements attached to it to the ground.  Jondalar reached under her tunic, lifting it as he found the round shapes with the hard, upright nipples. He lifted the tunic farther, exposing a dark pink areola surrounding the raised and sensitive node.  Feeling the warm fullness in his hand, he touched the nipple with his tongue, then took it in his mouth and pulled in.  Tingling strings of fire raced to the place deep within as a small moan of pleasure escaped her lips. She could hardly believe how ready she was. Like the dark red mammoth, she felt as though she had been waiting all day and could hardly wait another moment. A fleeting picture of the big russet bull, with his long, curved organ, flashed through her mind. Jondalar let go, and she took hold of the neck opening of her tunic and pulled it over her head in one smooth motion.  He caught his breath at seeing her, caressed her smooth skin, and reached for both full breasts. He fondled one hard nipple, squeezing and rubbing, while he suckled and pulled and nibbled on the other.  Ayla felt delightful shocks of excitement, and she closed her eyes 3s she gave herself up to them. When he stopped the delicious caressing and nuzzling, she kept her eyes closed, and soon she felt herself being kissed. She opened her mouth to admit a gently exploring tongue When she put her arms around his neck, she could feel the wrinkle5 ° his leather tunic against her still sensitive nipples.  noved his hands over the smooth skin of her back and felt the ient of her firm muscles. Her immediate response had added to i ardor, and his hard, erect manhood strained against his cloth- woman!" he breathed. "How I want you." a ready for you." t let me get these off," he said. He unfastened his belt, then his tunic up his back and over his head. Ayla saw the straining caressed it, and then began untying his drawstring, while he id hers. They both stepped out of their leggings and reached for [her, standing close in a long, slow, sensuous kiss. Jondalar r scanned the clearing, looking for a place, but Ayla dropped to her hands and knees, then looked back up at him with a .smile.  it fur may be yellow, and not light brown, but you are the one ie," she said.  miled back and dropped down behind her. "And your hair isn't ed, it's the color of ripe hay, but it holds something that is, ling like a red flower with many petals. But I don't have a furry o reach you. I'll have to use something else," he said.  pushed her forward slightly, separated her cheeks to expose her female opening, then bent down to taste her warm salt. He i his tongue forward and found her hard nodule buried deep in ds. She gasped and moved to give him easier access, while he id and nuzzled, then dipped deep into her inviting opening to id explore. He always loved to taste of her.  l was moving on a wave of sensations, hardly aware of anything the hot pulses of feeling coursing through her. She was more sually sensitive, and every place he touched or kissed burned its rough her to the ultimate spot deep within that tingled with fire aming. She didn't hear her own breath coming faster, or the f pleasure she made, but Jondalar did.  traightened up behind her, moved in closer, and found her deep ith his eager straining manhood. As he started penetrating, she back, pushing herself on him until she took all of him in. He »ut at her unbelievably warm welcome, then, holding her hips, back a ways. He reached around with his hand and found her tard node of pleasure and stroked it as she pushed back in. His on nearly found its peak. He pulled back once more and, sensing diness, stroked faster and harder, as he penetrated fully. She 'Ut her release, and his own voice cried out with hers.  1 ^s lying stretched out, face down in the grass, the pleasant  weight of Jondalar on top of her, and felt his breath on the left side of her back. She opened her eyes and, without any desire to move watched an ant crawling on the ground around a single stem. She felt the man stir and then roll over, keeping his arm around her waist.  "Jondalar, you are an unbelievable man. Do you have any idea how remarkable you are?" Ayla said.  "Haven't I heard those words before? Seems to me I said them to you," he said.  "But they're true for you. How do you know me so well? I get lost inside my own self, just feeling what you do to me." "I think you were ready." "That's true. It's always wonderful, but this time, I don't know.  Maybe it was the mammoths. I've been thinking about that pretty red mammoth, and her wonderful big bull—and you—all day." "Well, maybe we'll have to play at being mammoths again," he said, with a big smile, as he rolled over on his back.  Ayla sat up. "All right, but right now I'm going to go play in the river before it gets dark"—she bent down and kissed him and tasted herself on him—"after I check on the food." She ran to the fireplace, turned the bison roast again, took out the cooking stones and added a couple more from the dying fire that were still hot, put a few pieces of wood in the flames, and ran toward the river. It was cold when she splashed in, but she didn't mind. She was used to cold water. Jondalar soon joined her, carrying a large, soft buckskin hide. He put it down and entered more carefully, finally taking a deep breath and plunging in. He came up pushing his hair out of his eyes.  "That's cold!" he said.  She came up beside him and, with a mischievous smile, splashed him. He splashed her back, and a noisy water fight ensued. With one last splash, Ayla bounded out of the water, grabbed the soft hide, and began to dry herself. She handed it to Jondalar when he emerged from the river, then hurried back to the campsite and quickly dressed. She was ladling the soup into their personal bowls as Jondalar walked up from the river. .he last rays of the summer sun gleamed through the branches fe trees as it dropped over the edge of the high ground to the west.  Joe at Jondalar with contentment, Ayla reached into her bowl for tet ripe raspberry and popped it in her mouth. Then she got up to | up and arrange things for a quick and easy departure in the l^- K gave Wolf the leftovers from their bowls and put cracked and led grains--the wild wheat, barley, and goosefoot seeds that Nez- |d given her when they left--into the warm soup and left it at the jofthe firepit. The cooked bison roast and tongue from their meal |put into a rawhide parfleche in which she stored food. She folded (urge envelope of stiff leather together, tied it with sturdy cords, luspended it from the center of a tripod of long poles, to keep it if the reach of night prowlers.  lie tapering poles were made from whole trees, tall, thin, straight tiwith the branches and bark stripped off, and Ayla carried them |Bcial holders sticking up from the back of Whinney's two pack |ts, just as Jondalar carried the shorter tent poles. The lengthy | were also used on occasion to make a travois that could be |ed behind the horses to transport heavy or bulky loads. They ifce long wooden poles along with them because trees that would I suitable replacements were so rare on the open steppes. Even |ivers there was often little more than tangled brush.  isthe twilight deepened, Jondalar added more wood to the fire, t the slab of ivory with the map scratched on it and brought it study it by the firelight. When Ayla finished and sat beside ; seemed distracted and had that look of anxious concern that rten noticed the past few days. She watched him for a while, Ut some stones in the fire to boil water for the evening tea it was Stom to make, but instead of the flavorful but innocuous herbs tterally used, she took some packets out of her otter-skin medi- ^ Something calming might be helpful, maybe feverfew or "ine root, in a woodruff tea, she thought, though she wished she  knew what the problem was. She wanted to ask him but wasn't sure if she should. Finally she made a decision.  "Jondalar, do you remember last winter when you weren't sure ho}v I felt, and I wasn't sure how you felt?" she said.  He had been so deeply immersed in his thoughts that it took a few moments before he comprehended her question. "Of course I remem ber. You don't have any doubts how much I love you, do you? I don't have any doubts about your feelings for me." "No, I don't have any doubts about that, but misunderstandings can be about many things, not just if you love me, or if I love you, and I don't want to let anything like last winter ever happen again. I don't think I could stand to have any more problems just because we didn't talk about it. Before we left the Summer Meeting, you promised to tell me if anything was bothering you. Jondalar, something is bothering you, and I wish you would tell me what it is." "It's nothing, Ayla. Nothing you have to worry about." "But it's something you have to worry about? If something is wor rying you, don't you think I should know about it?" she said. She took two small tea holders, each woven out of split reeds into a fine mesh, out of a wicker container in which she kept various bowls and utensils.  She paused for a moment, considering, then selected the dried leaves of feverfew and woodruff, added to chamomile for Jondalar, and just the chamomile for herself, and filled the tea holders. "If it concerns you, it must concern me, too. Aren't we traveling together?" "Well, yes, but I'm the one who made the decision, and I don't want to upset you unnecessarily," Jondalar said, getting up for the waterbag, which was hanging from a pole near the entrance to the tent that was set back a few paces from the fireplace. He poured a quantity of liquid into a small cooking bowl and added the hot stones.  "I don't know if it's necessary or not, but you are already upsetting me. Why not tell me the reason?" She put the tea holders into their individual wooden cups, poured steaming water over them, and put them aside to steep.  Jondalar picked up the marked piece of mammoth tusk and looked at it, wishing it would tell him what lay ahead and whether he was making the right decision. When it was just his brother and him, ll didn't matter too much. They were on a Journey, an adventure, and whatever came along was part of it. He wasn't sure, then, if they would ever return; he wasn't even sure if he wanted to. The woman he was forbidden to love had chosen a path that led even farther away, 311" the one he was expected to mate was... just not the one he wanted.  But this Journey was different. This time, he was with a woman b® loved more than life itself. He not only wanted to get back home, but • I fQ get her there, and safely. The more he thought about the dancers they might encounter along the way, the more he d even greater ones, but his vague worries were not something »1 easily explain.  tf-iust worried about how long this Journey will take. We need to bat glacier before the end of winter," he said.  i told me that before," she said. "But why? What will happen if ft reach it by then?" she asked.  ; ice starts to melt in spring and it becomes too dangerous to C a crossing." 1 if it's too dangerous, then we won't attempt it. But if we can't what do we do then?" she asked, pushing him to think about irives he had avoided thinking about. "Is there any other way to l not sure. The ice we have to cross is just a small plateau glacier Ion a highland north of the great mountains. There is land to the I of it, but no one ever goes that way. It would take us even more four way, and it's cold. They say the northern ice is closer there, IS south in that region. The land between the high mountains of ibuth and the great ice of the north is the coldest anywhere. It prgets warm, not even in summer," Jondalar said.  Kit isn't it cold on that glacier you want to cross?" (&f course, it's cold on the glacier, too, but it's a shorter way, and be other side it's only a few days to Dalanar's Cave." Jondalar put fs. the map to take the cup of hot tea Ayla was handing him, and Hared into the steaming contents for a while. "I suppose we could < northern route around the highland glacier, if we had to, but I W not want to. That's flathead country, anyway," Jondalar tried Xplain.  ^t»u mean people of the Clan live north of that glacier we're sup- id to cross?" Ayla asked, stopping just as she was taking the tea w out of her cup. She was feeling a strange mixture of dread and iBftment.  pi sorry. I guess I should call them Clan people, but they are not Onae as the ones you knew. They live very far from here, you ad not believe how far. They are not the same at all." |"t they are, Jondalar," Ayla said, then took a sip of the hot, j'fal liquid. "Maybe their everyday language and ways might be a 'lifferent, but all Clan people have the same memories, at least der memories. Even at the Clan Gathering, everyone knew the 't sign language that is used to address the spirit world, and spoke a other with it," Ayla said.  Ut they don't want us in their territory," Jondalar said. "They already let us know that when Thonolan and I happened to be on the wrong side of the river." "I'm sure that's true. People of the Clan don't like to be around the Others. So, if we can't cross the glacier when we get there, and we can't go around it, then what do we do?" Ayla asked, going back to the original problem. "Can't we wait until the glacier is safe to cross again?" "Yes. I suppose we'd have to, but it might be almost a year until the next winter." "But if we waited a year, then we could make it? Is there a place we could wait?" "Well, yes, there are people we could stay with. The Losadunai have always been friendly. But I want to get home, Ayla," he said with a tone of such anguish that it made her realize pst how important it was to him. "I want us to get settled." "I want to get settled, too, Jondalar, and I think we should do everything we can to try to get there while it's still safe to cross the glacier. But if it's too late, it doesn't mean we won't get back to your home. It only means a longer wait. And we would still be together." "That's true," Jondalar said, acquiescing but not happy. "I guess it wouldn't be so bad if we did get there late, but I don't want to wait around for a whole year," he said, and then his frown tightened. "And maybe if we went the other way, we would get there in time. It's still not too late." "There is another way to go?" "Yes, Talut told me we could go around the north end of the mountain range we'll be coming to. And Rutan of Feather Grass Camp said the route was northwest of here. I've been thinking that maybe we should go that way, but I had hoped to see the Sharamudoi once more.  If I don't see them now, I'm afraid I never will, and they live around the south end of the mountains, along the Great Mother River," Jondalar explained.  Ayla nodded, thinking. Now I understand. "The Sharamudoi are the people you lived with for a while; your brother mated a woman 01 those people, right?" "Yes, they are like family to me." "Then of course we must go south so you can visit them one la51 time. They are people you love. If it means we may not get to the glacier in time, then we'll wait until the next season for crossing. E^ if it means waiting another year before we reach your home, don't y011 think it would be worth it to see your other family again? If part of the reason you want to go home is to tell your mother about your brothe1'' roll think the Sharamudoi would like to know what happened to J- were his family, too." frowned, then brightened. "You're right, Ayla. They at to know about Thonolan. I've been so worried about made the right decision, I just didn't think it through." He relief.  idalar watched the flames dancing over the blackened sticks of leaping and cavorting in their short-lived joy as they beat back icroaching dark. He sipped his tea, still thinking about the long ey ahead of them, but he didn't feel quite as anxious about it. He d over at Ayla. "It was a good idea to talk it over. I guess I'm still sed to having someone around that I can talk to about... things.  I think we can make it in time or I wouldn't have decided to go fsy in the first place. It will make a longer trip, but at least I know oute. I don't know the northern way." hink you made the right decision, Jondalar. If I could, if I hadn't cursed with death, I would visit Brun's clan," Ayla said, then 1, so low that he could hardly hear her, "If I could, if I only , I would go to see Durc one last time." The forlorn, empty sound " voice made him aware that she was feeling her loss acutely just o you want to try to find him, Ayla?" is, of course I want to, but I can't. It would only cause everyone ss. I was cursed. If they saw me they would think I was an evil , I am dead to them, and there isn't anything I could do or say would convince them that I am alive." Ayla's eyes seemed to be ig far away, but they were seeing an inner vision, a memory.  ;sides, Durc isn't the baby I left behind. He is getting close to ood, though I was late in reaching womanhood, for a woman of lan. He is my son, and he may lag behind the other boys, too.  aon Ura will be coming to live with Brun's clan--no, it's Broud's now," Ayla said, frowning. "This is the summer of the Clan iring, so this fall Ura will leave her clan and go to live with Brun ^bra, and when they are both old enough, she will be Durc's " She paused, then added, "I wish I could be there to welcome )ut I would only scare her, and maybe make her think Durc is ky, if the spirit of his strange mother won't stay where she be- in the other world." 'e you sure, Ayla? I mean it, we'll take the time to look for them, want," Jondalar said.  'en if I wanted to find him," she said, "I wouldn't know where to I don't know where their new cave is, and I don't know where  the Clan Gathering is. It is not meant for me to see Durc. He is not my son any more. I gave him to Uba. He is Uba's son now." Ayla looked up atjondalar. He noticed that tears were threatening. "I knew when Rydag died I would never see Durc again. I buried Rydag in Durc's carrying cloak, the one I took with me when I left the Clan and in my heart, I buried Durc at the same time. I know I will never see Durc again. I am dead to him, and it's best if he is dead to me." The tears were wetting her cheeks, though she seemed oblivious to them, as though she didn't know they had begun. "I'm really lucky you know. Think of Nezzie. Rydag was a son to her, she nursed him even if she didn't give birth to him, and she knew she would lose him.  She even knew that no matter how long he lived, he would never have a normal life. Other mothers who lose their sons can only imagine them in another world, living with spirits, but I can imagine Durc here, always safe, always lucky, always happy. I can think of him living with Ura, having children at his hearth... even if I will never see them." The sob in her voice finally opened the way to let her grief out.  Jondalar took her in his arms and held her. Thinking of Rydag made him sad, too. There was nothing anyone could have done for him, though everyone knew Ayla had tried. He was a weak child. Nezzie said he always had been. But Ayla had given him something no one else could. After she came and started teaching him, and the rest of the Lion Camp, to talk the way the Clan did, with hand signs, he was happier than he had ever been. It was the first time in all his young life that he had been able to communicate with the people he loved. He could let his needs and wishes be known, and he could let people know how he felt, especially Nezzie, who had taken care of him since his real mother died, at his birth. He could finally tell her that he loved her.  It had been a surprise to the members of the Lion Camp, but once they realized that he wasn't just a rather clever animal, without the ability to speak, but instead, a different kind of person, with a different kind of language, they began to understand that he was intelligent, and to accept him as a person. It had been no less a surprise to Jondalar, even though she had tried to tell him, after he began to teach her to speak with words again. He had learned the signs along with the oW ers, and he had come to appreciate the gentle humor and the depth o understanding in the young boy from the ancient race.  Jondalar held the woman he loved as she heaved great sobs in the release of her sorrow. He knew Ayla had held back her grief over to death of the half-Clan child that Nezzie had adopted, who had w- minded her so much of her own son, and understood she was grieviDg for that son as well. g it was more than Rydag or Durc. Ayla was grieving for all her the ones from long ago, her loved ones from the Clan, and 's of the Clan itself. Brim's clan had been her family, Iza and raised her, cared for her, and in spite of her difference, there time when she thought of herself as Clan. Though she had to leave with Jondalar because she loved him and wanted to be their talk had made her realize how far away he lived; it he a year, maybe two years just to travel there. The full idine of what that meant had finally come to her; she would nvijrn.  "was not only giving up her new life with the Mamutoi, who had td her a place among them, she was giving up any faint hope she (t have had of seeing the people of her clan again, or the son she feft with them. She had lived with her old sorrows long enough so (they had eased a little, but Rydag had died not long before they lie Summer Meeting, and his death was still too fresh, the grief too raw. The pain of it had brought back the pain of her other S, and the realization of the distance she would be putting between (had brought the knowledge that the hope of recovering that part STpast would have to die, too.  yla had already lost her early life; she had no idea who her real ter was, or who her people were, the ones she had been born to.  Spt for faint recollections--feelings more than anything--she could lemember anything before the time of the earthquake, or any 9e before the Clan. But the Clan had banished her; Broud had put snrse of death upon her. To them she was dead and now she came »e full understanding that she had lost that part of her life when |torned her out.

Whatever awaited atever his people were like, she would have nothing else; only '3ries... and the future.    i the wooded glade it was completely black. Not the faintest a silhouette or darker shadow could be discerned against the ttding background, except for a faint redness from the lingering i the fireplace, and the blazing epiphany of stars. With only a ^breeze penetrating the protected grove, they had moved their ^e furs outside the tent. Ayla lay awake under the starlit sky, staring up at the patterns of constellations and listening to the niphr sounds: the wind sifting through the trees, the soft liquid running nf the river, the chirk of crickets, the harsh harumph of a bullfrog. Sh heard a loud plunk and splashing, then the eerie who-iohoing of an ow] and in the distance, the deep roar of a lion and the loud trumpet of a mammoth.  Earlier Wolf had quivered with excitement at the sound of wolf howls and then run off. Not long afterward she heard wolf song again and an answering howl much closer. The woman was waiting for the animal to return. When she heard his panting breath--he must have been running, she thought--and felt him snuggle up to her feet, she relaxed.  She had just dozed off when she suddenly found herself wide awake.  Alert and tense, she lay still, trying to discover what woke her. First she felt the rumbling, almost silent growl vibrating through her coverings from the warm spot at her feet. Then she heard faint snufflings.  Something was in camp with them.  "Jondalar?" she said softly.  "I think the meat is drawing something. It could be a bear, but I think it's more likely to be a wolverine or a hyena," Jondalar replied, his whisper barely audible.  "What should we do? I don't want anything to get our meat." "Nothing, yet. Whatever it is may not be able to reach it. Let's -- » wait.  But Wolf knew exactly what was nosing around and had no intention of waiting. Wherever they set up camp, he denned it as his territory and took it upon himself to defend it. Ayla felt him leave, and an instant later heard him snarl menacingly. The growling response had an entirely different tone and seemed to come from higher up. Ayla sat up and reached for her sling, but Jondalar was already on his feet with the long shaft of a spear resting on his spear-thrower in readiness.  "It's a bear!" he said. "I think he's up on his hind legs, but I can't see a thing." They heard movement, shuffling sounds from somewhere between the fireplace and the poles from which the meat was suspended, then the growling warnings of the animals facing off. Suddenly, from the other side, Whinney neighed, then, even louder. Racer voiced his nervousness.  There were more sounds of movement in the dark, and then Ayla heard the particular excited deep snarling rumble that signaled Wolfs intention to attack.  "Wolf!" Ayla called out, trying to prevent the dangerous encounter' Suddenly, amid vicious snarls, a sonorous bellow rang out, then a  I.  .of pai" as a scattering of bright sparks flew around a large shape bline into the fireplace. Ayla heard the whistle of an object mov- ipidly through the air nearby. A solid thunk was followed by a and then the noise of something crashing through the trees, ng away fast. Ayla whistled the call she used for Wolf. She did rant him to follow.  e knelt down to hug the young wolf with relief when he came to while Jondalar built up the fire again.

He thought she was still think- ff"°ut the child who had died and the son she would never see .»:» and he didn't quite know what to say. He wanted to help but want to intrude. They were sitting together close to the fire,  ^ sipping, the tea, when Ayla happened to look up at the sky. She caught her breath.  "Look, Jondalar," she said. "In the sky. It's red, like a fire, but high up and far away. What is it?" "Ice Fire!" he said. "That's what we call it when it's red like that, or sometimes Fires of the North." They watched the luminous display for a while as the northern lights arced across the sky like gossamer drapes blowing in a cosmic wind.  "It has white bands in it," Ayla said, "and it's moving, like streaks of smoke, or white chalky water rippling through it. And other colors too." "Star Smoke," Jondalar said. "That's what some people call it, or Star Clouds when it's white. It has different names. Most people know what you mean when you use any name like that." "Why haven't I seen this light in the sky before, I wonder?" Ayla said, feeling awe, and a touch of fear.  "Maybe you lived too far south. That's why it is also called Fires of the North. I haven't seen it very often and never this strong, or this red, but people who have made northern Journeys claim the farther north you go, the more you see it." "But you can only go as far north as the wall of ice." "You can travel north beyond the ice, if you go by water. West of the place where I was born, several days' distance, depending on the season, the land comes to an end at the edge of the Great Waters. It is very salty, and it never freezes, although large chunks of ice are some times seen. They say some people have traveled beyond the wall of ice in boats, when they are hunting animals that live in the water," Jon dalar said.  "You mean like the bowl boats the Mamutoi used to cross rivers?" "Like them, I think, but bigger and stronger. I never saw them, and I wasn't sure if I believed the stories until I met the Sharamudoi and saw the boats they make. Many trees grow along the Mother River, near their Camp, big trees. They make boats out of them. Wait until you meet them. You won't believe it, Ayla. They don't just cross the river, they travel on it, both upstream and downstream in those boats.  Ayla noticed his enthusiasm. He was really looking forward to j seeing them again, now that he had resolved his dilemma. But she w^ not thinking about meeting Jondalar's other people. The strange lig11 in the sky worried her. She wasn't sure why, exactly. It was unnerving and she wished she understood what it meant, but it didn't fill ne with fear the way earthly disturbances did. She was terrified of a^ movements of the earth, especially earthquakes, not just because the r of what should be solid earth was frightening in itself, but [ (.ugy had always signaled drastic, wrenching change in her life.  thquake had torn her away from her own people and given Idhood that was alien to everything she had known, and an he had led to her ostracism from the Clan, or at least given l excuse for it.

He was hesitant to tell her the beliefs | people that when the northern lights were red, it was often Hered a warning, but not always. Sometimes it just presaged thing important.

Even with the sedative, Ayla felt as though sleep was RPg her. She tried every position to fall asleep, first on her side, |er back, then the other side, even her stomach, and she was sure Rising and turning was bothering Jondalar. When she finally did f, her sleep was disturbed by vivid dreams.

The mog-urs picked up the body and, with solemn ^carried it into a cave. Creb, in his bearskin cloak, hobbled in the lead.  ^ftared at a white liquid sloshing in a cracked wooden bowl. The liquid wwod red, and thickened, as white, luminous bands moved in slow ripples » tt- She felt an anxious worry, she had done something wrong. There wasn't supposed to be any liquid left in the bowl. She held it to her lips a^ drained it.  Her perspective changed, the white light was inside her, and she seemed to he growing larger and looking down from high above at stars blazing a path. The stars changed to small flickering lights leading through a long endless cave. Then a red light at the end grew large, filling her vision, and with a sinkinp sickening feeling, she saw the mog-urs sitting in a circle, half-hidden by stalao.  mite pillars.  She was sinking deeper into a black abyss, petrified with fear. Suddenly Creh was there with the glowing light inside her, helping her, supporting her, easino her fears. He guided her on a strange trip back to their mutual beginnings through salt water and painful gulps of air, loamy earth and high trees. Then they were on the ground, walking upright on two legs, walking a great distance going west toward a great salty sea. They came to a steep wall that faced a river and a flat plain, with a deep recess under a large overhanging section; it was the cave of an ancient ancestor of his. But as they approached the cave, Creb began fading, leaving her.  The scene grew hazy, Creb was fading faster, was nearly gone, and she felt panicky. "Creb! Don't go, please don't go!" she called out. She scanned the landscape, searching desperately for him. Then she saw him at the top of the cliff, above his ancestor's cave, near a large boulder, a long, slightly flattened column of rock that tilted over the edge, as though frozen in place as it was about to fall. She called out again, but he had faded into the rock. Aylafelt desolate; Creb was gone and she was alone, aching with sorrow, wishing she had something of his to remember, something to touch, to hold, but all she had was an overwhelming sorrow. Suddenly she was running, running as fast as she could; she had to get away, she had to get away.    "Ayla! Ayla! Wake up!"Jondalar said, shaking her.  "Jondalar," she said, sitting up. Then, still feeling the desolation, she clung to him, as tears fell. "He's gone... Oh, Jondalar." "It's all right," he said, holding her. "It must have been a terrible dream. You were shouting and crying. Do you think it would help if you told me?" "It was Creb. I dreamt about Creb, and that time at the Clan Gathering when I went into the cave and those strange things happened.  For a long time afterward, he was very upset with me. Then, just as we were finally getting back together, he died, before we could even talk very much. He told me Durc was the son of the Clan. I never w35 sure what he meant. There was so much I wish we could have talked about, so much I wish I could ask him now. Some people just though1 of him as the powerful Mog-ur, and his missing eye and arm made hin1  r " ^ more frightening. But they didn't know him. Creb was kind.

Wolf decided c the bear and plunged ahead through the underbrush, heading an. They had traveled less than a mile when they heard a com- I ahead, snarls and growls.

"Go ahead," W: taking out his sharp knife.  W became very excited when Ayla started to throw stones and  ^ chase the wolf pack, and he stood guard over the bear carcass as Ton dalar quickly cut away the claws. The teeth were somewhat harder tn dig out of the jaws, but the man soon had his trophies. Ayla was watching Wolf, smiling. As soon as his "pack" had chased away the wild pack, his entire manner and posture changed. He was holding his head up, his tail straight back, in the stance of a dominant wolf, and his snarl was more aggressive. The pack's leader was watching him closely and seemed close to challenging him.  After they relinquished the bear carcass to the pack again and were walking away, the pack leader threw back his head and howled. It was deep-voiced and powerful. Wolf lifted his head and howled in return but his song lacked the resonance. He was younger, hardly even full grown, and it showed in his tone.  "Come on. Wolf. That one's bigger than you, not to mention older and wiser. He'd have you on your back in a heartbeat or two," Ayla said, but Wolf howled again, not in challenge, but because he was in a community of his kind.  The other wolves of the pack joined in until Jondalar felt surrounded by a chorus of yips and howls. Then, just because she felt like it, Ayla lifted her head and howled. It sent a shiver down the man's back and raised gooseflesh. To his ear, it was a perfect imitation of the wolves.  Even Wolf cocked his head toward her, then voiced another long wail of more confident tones. The other wolves answered in kind and soon the woods were again filled with the spine-tingling, beautiful wolf song.  When they got back to camp, Jondalar cleaned up the bear claws and canine teeth, while Ayla packed Whinney, and he was still packing, not quite ready to go when she was done. She was leaning against the mare, absently scratching her and feeling the comfort of her presence, when she noticed that Wolf had found another rotten old bone.  This time he kept to the far edge of the glade, growling playfully W1"1 his rank prize, keeping an eye on the woman, but making no attemp1 to bring it to her.  "Wolf. Come here, Wolf." she called. He dropped his bone and came to her. "I think it's time to begin teaching you something n^' she said.  She wanted him to learn to stay in one place when she told himt01 even if she went away. It was a command that she felt would important for him to learn, though she feared he would be a long t101 in the learning. Judging from the reception they had received thus from people they had met, and Wolfs reaction, she worried about w5' going after strangers from another "pack" of humans. once promised Talut that she would kill the wolf herself if t anyone at Lion Camp, and she still felt it was her respon- iake sure that the carnivorous animal she had brought into t with people would not harm anyone.

He mounted Racer while she put ray, and then she climbed on Whinney's back.  itural inclination for that horse to let you ride on his back?" think that's the same, Ayla," Jondalar said as they started ie camp riding the horses side by side. "Horses eat grass, eat meat, and I think they are by nature more inclined to Me. When they see strangers, or something that seems ',, they want to run away.

I don't think he would unless he 7C thought one of us was threatened. Animals can learn, just like peoni can. It's not his natural inclination to think of people and horses as h' 'pack.' Even Whinney has learned things that she would not have 't I she lived with other horses. How natural is it for a horse to think of wolf as a friend? She even had a cave lion for a friend. Is that a natural inclination?" "Maybe not," Jondalar said, "but I can't tell you how worried I wac when Baby showed up at the Summer Meeting and you rode straight up to him on Whinney. How did you know he'd remember you? Or Whinney? Or that Whinney would remember him?" "They grew up together. Baby... I mean Baby..." The word she used meant "baby" but it had an odd sound and inflection, unlike any language she and Jondalar usually spoke, a rough, guttural quality, as though spoken from the throat. Jondalar could not reproduce it, could hardly even approximate the sound; it was one of the relatively few spoken words from the language of the Clan. Though she had said it often enough that he recognized it, Ayla had formed the habit of immediately translating any Clan word she happened to use to make it easier. When Jondalar referred to the lion Ayla had raised from a cub, he used the translated form of the name she had given him, but it always struck him as incongruous that a gigantic male cave lion should have the name "Baby." "... Baby was... a cub when I found him, a baby. He hadn't even been weaned. He'd been kicked in the head, by a running deer, I think, and was almost dead. That's why his mother left him. He was like a baby to Whinney, too. She helped me take care of him--it was so funny when they started playing with each other, especially when Baby would sneak up and try to get Whinney's tail. I know there were times when she waved it at him on purpose. Or they'd each grab an end of a hide and try to pull it away from each other. I lost so many hides that year, but they made me laugh." Ayla's expression turned pensive. "I never really learned to laugh until then. The people of the Clan didn't laugh out loud. They didn't like unnecessary noises, and loud sounds were usually meant for warnings.  And that look you like, with teeth showing, that we call a snul^ They made it to mean they were nervous, or feeling protective and defensive, or with a certain hand sign as implying a threatening g^" ture. It wasn't a happy look to them. They didn't like it when I w^ little if I smiled or laughed, so I learned not to do it very much." They rode along the river's edge for a distance, on a flat, wide stretcii of gravel. "Many people smile when they're nervous, and when they meet strangers," Jondalar said. "It's not meant to be defensive ^  pf "though. I think a smile is meant to show that you're not ad in single file, Ayla leaned to the side to guide her horse i brush growing beside a streamlet that was making its way After Jondalar had developed the halter device that he de Racer, Ayla also started using one to help lead Whinney f or to tie her to something to keep her in one location, but I the horse was wearing it, Ayla never used it when she was ; had never intended to train the animal when she first got e's back, and the mutual learning process had been gradual ; beginning, unconscious.

If he's protecting you, how are you going to train him to sta where you tell him, if you're not there? How can you teach him not t attack strangers if he decides he wants to?" Jondalar's concern w serious. He wasn't sure that taking the animal with them was such good idea. Wolf could create a lot of problems. "Remember, wolvw attack to get their food; that's the way the Mother made them. Wolfic a hunter. You can teach him many things, but how can you teach a hunter not to be a hunter? Not to attack strangers?" "You were a stranger when you came to my valley, Jondalar. Do you remember when Baby came back to visit me and found you there'" Ay la asked, as they again separated into single file to start up a gully leading away from the river toward the highland.  Jondalar felt a flush of heat, not exactly embarrassment, but a recollection of the strong emotions of that encounter. He had never been so scared in his life; he had been sure he was going to die.  It took some time to pick their way up the shallow ravine, around rocks that washed down during spring floods, and black-stemmed ar- temisia brush that burst into life when the rains came and retreated into dry stalks that appeared dead when they stopped. He thought about the time Baby came back to the place where Ayla had raised him and found a stranger on the broad ledge in front of her small cave.  None of them were small, but Baby was the biggest cave lion he'd ever seen, nearly as tall as Whinney, and more massive. Jondalar was still recovering from the mauling that same lion, or his mate, had given him earlier when he and his brother had foolishly broached their den.  It was the last thing Thonolan was ever to do. Jondalar was sure he was seeing his last moments when the cave lion roared and gathered himself to spring. Suddenly Ayla was between them, holding up her hand in a motion to stop, and the lion stopped! It would have been comical the way that huge beast pulled himself up short and twisted around co avoid her, if he hadn't been so petrified. The next thing he knew, she was scratching the gigantic cat and playing with him.  "Yes, I remember," he said, when they reached the highland and again rode side by side. "I still don't know how you made him stop ii1 the middle of that attack on me." "When Baby was just a cub, he made a game of attacking me, but when he started to grow, he got too big for me to play that kind or game with him. He was too rough. I had to teach him to stop," Ay^ explained. "Now I have to teach Wolf not to attack strangers, and to stay behind if I want him to. Not only so he won't hurt people, but so they won't hurt him."  ie can teach him, Ayla, you can," Jondalar said.

Zeiandoni always told me Doni I 79 would never refuse me anything I asked Her, but she warned me to be careful what I asked for, because I would get it, she said. That's why she made me promise not to ask the Mother for her, when she was still Zolena.  Why would anyone ask for something if he didn't want it? I never really understand those who speak to the spirit world. They always have a shadow on their tongue. They used to say Thonolan was a favorite of Doni, when they talked about his flair for getting along with people. But then they say beware of the Mother's favors. If She favors too much, She doesn't want you be away from Her for too long. Is that why Thonolan died? Did the Great Earth Mother take him back?  What does it really mean when they say Doni favors someone?  I don't know if She favors me or not. But now I know Zolena made the right choice when she decided to embrace the zeiandonia. It was right for me, too. What I did was wrong, but I would never have made the Journey with Thonolan if she hadn't become Zeiandoni, and I would never have found Ayla. Maybe She does favor me, a little, but I don't want to take advantage of Doni's goodness to me. I have already asked Her to get us back safely; I can't ask Her to give Ayla a child of my spirit, especially not now. But I wonder, will she ever have one?    via and Jondalar turned away from the river they had been veering toward the west in their general southerly route, id across country. They came upon the valley of another course that was flowing east on its way to joining, somewhat m, the one they had left behind. The valley was broad, with assy slope leading to a swift river that was racing through ; of a level floodplain, strewn with stones of various sizes, »m large boulders to fine sandy gravel. Except for a few tufts id an occasional flowering herb, the rocky course was bare, vegetation by the spring deluge.  »gs, whole trees stripped of leaves and bark, sprawled across d clearing, while tangled alder brush and shrubs with gray- leaves hovered near the edge. A small herd of giant deer, ravagant palmate antlers made the large rack of the moose i, were feeding along the outer fringe of woolly willows a the damp lowland near the water.  is full of high spirits and had been darting under and around f the horses, particularly Racer. Whinney seemed able to exuberance, but the stallion was more excitable. Ayla e young horse would have responded to Wolfs playfulness ie had been allowed to, but with Jondalar guiding his move- wolfs antics only distracted him. The man was not pleased, quired him to keep a closer control over the horse. His was building up, and he was considering whether he should 'she couldn't keep the wolf away from Racer.  y, much to Jondalar's relief. Wolf dashed away. He had scent of the deer and gone to investigate. The first sight of gs of a giant deer was irresistible; Wolf decided it was an- rour-legged animal for him to play with. But when the stag :hed lowered his head to fend off the charging animal, Wolf 'e magnificent spreading antlers of the powerful deer were e feet long! The great beast nibbled on the broad-leaf grass not unmindful of the carnivore, but indifferent to him, as knew he had little to fear from a lone wolf.  Ayla, watching, smiled. "Look at him, Jondalar. Wolf thought that megaceros was another horse he could pester." Jondalar smiled, too. "He does look surprised. Those antlers are a little more than he expected." They rode slowly toward the water, understanding without sayinp so that neither of them wanted to startle the massive deer. They both felt a sense of awe as they neared the enormous creatures that towered over them, even on horseback. With a stately gracefulness, the herd edged away as the people and horses approached, not frightened, but cautious, browsing on the woolly willow leaves as they went.  "They are a little more than I expected, too," Ayla said. "I've never been this close before." Though only slightly larger than moose in actual physical size, the giant deer, with their magnificent, elaborate antlers, spreading out and up from the tops of their heads, seemed enormous. Each year the fantastic horns were shed and the new pair that grew in to replace them extended to greater lengths and more complexity, eventually reaching twelve feet or more on some old males in a single season. But even when their heads were bare, that greatest member of the deer tribe was huge in comparison with any other of its kind. The shaggy far and massive shoulder and neck muscles, which had developed to support the weight of the immense horns, contributed to their formidable aspect. Giant deer were animals of the plains. The prodigious antlers were an encumbrance in woodland, and they avoided any trees taller than brush; some had been known to starve to death, trapped by their own glorious rack caught in the branches of a tree.  When they reached the river, Ayla and Jondalar stopped and studied the waterway and the surrounding area to determine the best place to cross. The river was deep and the current swift, and large jagged boulders created rapids in places. They checked the conditions both upstream and downstream, but the nature of the river seemed consistent for some distance. Finally they decided to try to cross at a pla^ that seemed relatively free of rocks.  They both dismounted, tied the side pack baskets to the backs o their horses, and placed inside the foot-coverings and the warm outer^ wear they had donned in the chill of the morning. Jondalar removed his sleeveless shirt, and Ayla considered stripping entirely so s wouldn't have to worry about drying her clothes, but a check of t water temperature with her foot changed her mind. She was used cold water, but this fast-moving stream felt as icy as the water she "a left out the night before and found in the morning with a thin fr0^ film on top. Even wet, the soft buckskin-leather tunic and legi?108'!  would provide some warmth. the horses were agitated, moving back from the wet edge with - ^eps, whickering, neighing, and tossing their heads. Ayla halter with the lead rope on Whinney to help guide the horse he water. Then, sensing the mare's growing unease, the young hugged the shaggy neck and talked to her with the comforting language she had invented when they were together in the lad developed it unconsciously, building on the complex signs, narily on the few words that were part of the language of the nd she had added the repetitive nonsense sounds she and her I begun to use, to which she had assigned meaning.

It her to see the closeness that had developed between them.  icr thoughts turned for a moment to the way his hands could er feel, and she flushed slightly. He didn't calm her.  horses were not the only nervous animals. Wolf knew what was and was not anticipating the cold swim. Whining and pacing down the bank, he finally sat down and pointed his nose up, his complaint in a mournful howl.  ie here, Wolf," Ayla said, stooping down to hug the young "Are you a little frightened, too?" e going to give us problems again, crossing this river?" Jondalar ill feeling annoyed at the wolf for bothering him and Racer not a problem for me. He's just a little nervous, like the horses yla said, wondering why Wolfs perfectly understandable fears to annoy Jondalar, especially when he was so understanding of ng stallion.  river was cold, but the horses were strong swimmers, and once ;re coaxed in, they had no problem reaching the opposite shore, Ae humans as much as being led by them. Even Wolf was no He danced and whined on the bank, advancing on the cold water and retreating a few times, then finally he plunged in. WiriiiSl nose held high, he struck out after the horses that were piled high J-?  packs and bundles, and the humans swimming alongside.  Once they gained the other side, they stopped to change and drv nit the animals, then continued on their way. Ay la remembered ore' river crossings she had made when she had traveled alone after leav the Clan, and she was grateful for the sturdy horses. Getting from side to the other of a river was never easy. At the least, when travelim, on foot, it usually involved getting wet. But with the horses, they couS cross many smaller watercourses with little more than a splash or rwn and even big rivers posed far less difficulty. ' As they continued traveling southwest, the terrain changed. The hills of the uplands, that were graduating into higher foothills as they approached the mountains to the west, were crossed with the deeply cut narrow valleys of rivers they had to cross. Some days Jondalar felt that they spent so much time going up and down, they made little progress forward, but the valleys offered sheltered campsites out oft wind, and the rivers supplied the necessary water in a land that v otherwise dry.  They stopped at the top of a high hill within the central area of t hilly upland plains that ran parallel to the rivers. A vast panorai commanded their view in all directions. Except for the faint gr shapes of mountains far to the west, the expansive vista was uninti rupted.  Though the windy, arid land could not have been more differel the steppes, spread out before the two riders in a monotone of endk waving grass flowing over low rolling hills, evoked the sea with ij featureless regularity. The analogy went deeper. For all the mono!  nous uniformity, the ancient grassland rippling in the wind was dece tively rich and varied, and like the sea, supported a profuse and exo array of life. Outlandish creatures, displaying a flourish of biologica costly social adornments in the form of luxurious horns and antle shags, ruffs, and humps, shared the great steppes with other aniir grown to magnificent size.  The woolly giants, mammoths and rhinoceroses, resplendent dense double furs--long flowing hair trailing over warm downy u"' layers--with thick layers of sustaining fat, flaunted extravagant ti and exaggerated nose horns. Giant deer, bedecked with stately r of immense palmate antlers, grazed alongside aurochs, the spl01 wild forerunners of herds of placid domestic cattle, which were us as huge as the massive bison that sported such enormous horns. limals displayed the size that was the result of the richness of ppes; there were great jerboas, giant hamsters, and ground is that were among the largest found anywhere.  extensive grasslands also supported a bounty of other animals, yith remarkable proportions. Horses, asses, and onagers parti- mace and food on the lowlands; wild sheep, chamois, and ibex higher ground. Saiga antelopes raced across the flatlands. Gal- ests along river valleys, or near ponds and lakes, and the occa- yooded steppes and tundra played host to deer of all varieties, lotted fallow and gentle roe deer to elk, red deer, and reindeer j moose, elk, and caribou when they migrated to other lands.  md rabbits, mice and voles, marmots, susliks, and lemmings ed in huge numbers; toads, frogs, snakes, and lizards had their iirds of every shape and size, from large cranes to tiny pipets, heir voice and color. Even insects had a role to play.  tremendous herds of grazers, as well as the browsers and seed were culled and kept in check by the ones who ate meat. Car- , who were more adaptable in their range of environment and ive wherever their prey lived, also reached tremendous size ; of the abundance and quality of their food supply. Gigantic >ns, up to twice the size of their later southern descendants, the young and old of even the largest grazers, though a woolly >th in its prime had little to fear. The usual choice of the great re the huge bison, aurochs, and deer, while packs of oversize wolves, and dholes selected from more middle-size game.  ivided the plentiful prey with lynxes, leopards, and small wild- itrous cave bears, essentially vegetarian and only limited , were twice the weight of the smaller brown or black bears, illso preferred an omnivorous diet that often included grass, the white bear of the icy coasts subsisted on meat from the sea.  i wolverines and steppe polecats took their toll of smaller ani- acluding the vast number and variety of rodents, as did the I sables, weasels, otters, ferrets, martens, minks, and stoats that ermines in snow. Some foxes also turned white, or the rich iled blue, to match the winter scenery and hunt in stealth.  and golden eagles, falcons, hawks, crows, and owls snatched acting, or unlucky, small prey on the wing, while vultures and ites cleaned up the leavings of others on the ground.  ^reat diversity and size of the animals that lived on those ancient | and their bonus of exaggerated and richly enhanced appen- hd supplementary growths, could only be sustained by an en-  vironment of exceptional quality. Yet it was a frigid, sere, demand; I land surrounded by mountain-high barriers of ice and bleak oceans ^s frozen water. It seemed a contradiction that such a harsh environm could provide the richness that was necessary for the lavish growth nt the animals but, in fact, the environment was entirely right for it. tl^ cold, dry climate fostered the growth of grass and inhibited the grort> of trees.  Trees, such as oaks or spruces, are luxuriant growths, but they tak a long time and ample moisture to mature. Woodlands may feed and support a range of other plants and animals, but trees need resource.  to maintain themselves, and they do not encourage the development of multitudes of large animals. A few animals may eat nuts or fruits and others may browse leaves, or even twig tips from a tree, but bark and wood are largely inedible, and grow back slowly once destroyed. The same energy and soil nutrients put into an equal weight of grass will feed many, many more, and the grass will constantly renew itself. A forest may be the quintessential example of rich, productive vegetabk life, but it was grass that gave rise to the extraordinary and abundant animal life, and it was the complex grassland that supported and maintained it.    Ay la was feeling uncomfortable, but she wasn't sure why. It was nothing specific, just a strange, edgy feeling. Before they started down the high hill, they had watched storm clouds gathering over the mountains to the west, seen flashes of sheet lightning, and heard distant rolling thunder. The sky above, however, was a clear, deep blue, with the sun still high, though past the zenith. It was unlikely to rain nearby, but she didn't like thunder. The deep rolling roar always reminded her of earthquakes.  Maybe it's just that my moon time should start in a day or two, Aytt thought, trying to dismiss the feeling. I had better keep my leather straps handy, and the mouflon wool Nezzie gave me. She told me it was the best padding to use when traveling, and she was right. Tut blood washes right out in cold water.  Ay la had not seen onagers before, and with her thoughts turned inward, she wasn't paying attention as they proceeded down the slope- She thought the animals she saw in the distance were horses. Butwn they got closer, she began to notice differences. They were ^S?"' smaller, their ears were longer, and their tails were not a flowingtr^ of many hair strands, but a shorter, thin shaft covered with the sa"" ^ kind of hair that was on their bodies, with a darker tuft at the e0^ Both kinds of animals had erect manes, but the onagers' were o10 j "he coats of the animals in the small herd were a light reddish their backs and sides, and a much paler, almost white color- neath, even on their legs and muzzles, but they had a dark ttg their backbones, plus another across their shoulders, and nds of the darker shade on their legs.  ung woman compared them with the general coloring of the hough her dun coat was a shade lighter than average, with a en yellow tone, most steppe horses were a similar neutral rown shade and generally resembled Whinney.

Ayla noticed that even Whinney showed more ian she usually did at the sight of other animals, and the herd >ed grazing and was watching them. Wolf was interested, too, issumed a stalking posture, ready to take out after them, but taled him to stay. She wanted to observe them.

They could subsiw even coarser food than horses, including bark, leaves, and roots When they got closer to the herd, Ayla noticed a pair of younp and couldn't help smiling. They reminded her of Whinney when was young. Just when the wolf yelped to get her attention.  "All right, Wolf. If you want to chase those... onagers"—she c.  the unfamiliar word slowly, getting used to the sound—"go ahea She was pleased with the progress she was making in training him \softline he didn't like staying in one place for long. He was still too full puppy ish enthusiasm and curiosity. Wolf yelped and bounded af the herd. With a startled burst, they raced away with a sustained six that soon left the young, would-be hunter behind. He caught up w Ayla and Jondalar as they were approaching a broad valley.  Though the valleys of rivers carrying the silt of slowly erodi mountains still cut across their path, the land was falling off gradua toward the basin of the Great Mother River delta and Beran Sea.  they were traveling south, the summer was deepening, and wai winds caused by the passage of atmospheric depressions across the; added to the increasing temperatures of the season, and to wead disturbances.  The two travelers no longer wore outer clothes, not even when th first got up. Ayla thought the cool, crisp air of early morning was t best time of the day. But the late afternoon was hot, hotter than usu she thought, wishing for a nice cool stream to swim in. She glanced the man riding a few paces ahead. He was bare to the waist, and bai legged, wearing only a loincloth. His long blond hair, pulled backil a thong at the nape of his neck, had lighter streaks from the sun, a was darker where the sweat had made it wet.  She caught glimpses of his clean-shaven face and liked being able see his strong )aw and well-defined chin, though she still had a residi feeling that it was odd to see a grown man without a beard. He h explained to her once that he liked to let his beard grow in winter, warm his face, but he always cut it off in summer, because it w cooler. He used a special sharp flint blade, one that he knapped huns and replaced when needed, to shave himself every morning.  Ayla, too, had stripped down to a short garment, patterned a" Jondalar's loincloth. Both were basically a length of soft leather,w, between the legs, and held on with a cord around the waist- .. Aa ill garment was worn with the loose end at the back tucked insid6' the one in front left out in a short flap. Hers was also held on , cord around the waist, but she started with a longer piece, ^ »th loose ends out, pulled together at the sides, to hang down t of apron in front and back. The effect was of a short skirt the sides. With the soft porous leather to sit on, riding for long on the back of a sweaty horse was more comfortable, though (skin across the animal's back helped, too.  Jar had used the high hill to check their location. He was with their progress, which made him feel easier about the , Ayla noticed that he seemed more relaxed. Part of it, she yas his increasing skill in managing the young stallion. Though ridden the animal frequently before, traveling on horseback n the constant association that developed an understanding of character, preferences, and habits, and allowed the horse to ?. Even his muscles had learned to adjust to the animal's motion seat was more comfortable, both for him and the stallion.  ^yla thought his easy, relaxed riding indicated more than facility on horseback. There was less tension in his movements, sensed that his concern had diminished. Though she couldn't face, she guessed that his frown of worry would be gone, and might be in a mood for smiling. She loved it when he smiled playful. She watched the way his muscles moved beneath his skin as he matched Racer's gait with a gentle up-and-down and she felt a glow of warmth that was not from the tempera- . and smiled to herself. She loved watching him.  ird the west, they could still see the mountains rising up purple istance, capped by glistening white that pierced the dark clouds below. They seldom saw the icy peaks, and Jondalar was j the rare pleasure. Most often they were hidden by low misty hat clung like soft white furs cloaking a sparkling secret, open- enough to reveal tempting glimpses and make them more de- 'as feeling warm, too, and wished they were closer to those j>ped mountaintops, at least as close as the Sharamudoi lodges.  an he noticed the glint of water in the valley below and glanced ky to check the position of the sun, though it was earlier than ie decided they might as well stop and make camp. They were good time, traveling faster than he had estimated, and he didn't yv long it would take to reach the next source of water.  slope supported a rich growth of grass, primarily feather |fescues, and herbs mixed with varieties of quick-seeding anses.  The thick loess subsoil, which supported a black fertile lit was high in the humus of decaying plantlife, even encour- |es, which, except for the occasional scrub pine struggling for so subsoil water, were unusual for the steppes in this vicinity. An mixed woods of birch and larch, conifers that dropped their needli'iL winter, marched downhill with them, with alder and willow fillin iS lower down. At the bottom of the slope, where the land leveled some distance from the gurgling stream, Ayla was surprised to see occasional dwarfed oak, beech, or linden in some of the open olac,?  She had not seen many large-leaf trees since she left the cave of Bm.' clan, on the well-watered southern end of the peninsula that jutted inn.  Beran Sea.  The small river weaved its way around brush as it meandered acn» the level valley floor, but one loop edged close to some tall, thin willow that were an extension of the more thickly forested slope of the oth» side. They usually liked to cross a river before making camp, so the» wouldn't have to get wet when they started in the morning, and the» decided to camp near the willows. They rode downstream, looking f» a place to cross, and found a wide, stony, fordable crossing, then rode back.  While they were setting up the tent, Jondalar found himself watch.  ing Ayla, conscious of her warm, tanned body, and thinking how lucky he was. Not only was she beautiful--her strength, her supple grace, the assurance of her movements, all pleased him--but she was a gooi traveling companion, contributing equally to their well-being. Though he felt responsible for her safety and wanted to protect her from harm, there was comfort in knowing he could rely on her. In some ways, traveling with Ayla was like traveling with his brother. He had felt protective toward Thonolan, too. It was his nature to be concerned fat those he cared about.  But only in some ways. When the young woman lifted her arms to shake out the ground cover, he became aware that the skin was lighter on the underside of her rounded breasts, and he had an urge to compare the tone with her browned arm. He didn't think that he might be staring, but he did notice when she stopped working and turned toward him. When he caught her eye, Ayla smiled slowly. ; Suddenly he felt an urge to do more than compare skin tones. » pleased him to know that if he wanted to share Pleasures with her rig"1 then, she would be willing. There was comfort in that, too. It w^ ' as necessary to seize every opportunity. The feeling was as strong, " the urgency was less, and sometimes waiting a bit made it better.  could think about it and enjoy the anticipation. Jondalar smiled bac ^ After they set up camp, Ayla wanted to explore the valley. u unusual to find such a thickly wooded area in the middle of the stepP" and she was curious.

The trees were not as large as the ones she remem- Mit respectable. Then she noticed the unusual plants growing Ie trees and knelt down to take a closer look.  grou going to collect those?"

"I think her name for them would be... what is your name for thi tree, Jondalar?" "I'm not sure. I don't think they grow near my home, but the Sha.  ramudoi name is 'beech.' " "Then I think these would be called 'beechdrops,' " she said, gettino up and brushing her hands together to dust them off.  Suddenly Wolf froze, his nose pointed toward the deep woods. Jondalar noticed his stalking posture and, remembering how Wolf had scented the bear, reached for a spear. He laid it on top of the groove in his spear-thrower, a shaped piece of wood about half the length of a spear, which was held in a horizontal position with his right hand. He fitted the hollow at the butt of the spear into the notch at the back of the thrower. Then he put his fingers through the two loops near the front of the throwing weapon, which reached a place just short of the middle of the spear, to hold the shaft in place as it rested on top of his spear-thrower. It was done quickly with a smooth motion, and he stood with knees slightly flexed, ready to cast. Ayla had reached for stones and was ready with her sling, wishing she had brought her spear-thrower, too.  Moving through the sparse undergrowth. Wolf made a dash toward a tree. There was a scurry of movement in the beechnut mast, then a small animal raced straight up the smooth trunk. Standing up on his hind legs, as though he was trying to climb the tree as well, Wolf yelped after the furry creature.  Suddenly a commotion up in the branches of the tree attracted their attention. They caught sight of the rich sable-brown coat and long sinuous shape of a beech marten chasing after the loudly chittenng squirrel, who thought it had just escaped up the tree. Wolf wasn't the only one who thought the squirrel was worthy of interest, but the large weasellike animal, a foot and a half in length with a bushy tail that added another twelve inches to its dimensions, had a much better chance of success. Racing through the high branches, it was as ninible and fleet as its intended prey. „ "I think that squirrel jumped out of the cooking skin into the coalSi Jondalar said, watching the drama unfold.  "Maybe he'll get away," Ayla said.  "It's doubtful. I wouldn't wager a broken blade on it." The squirrel was cluttering loudly. An excited jay squawking a ra  caw added to the disturbance, then a willow tit stridently an- ;ed its presence. Wolf couldn't stand it, he had to join in.  ;hing his head back, he voiced a long howl. The small squirrel ed out to the end of a limb; then, to the surprise of the two ling people, it leaped into the air. Spreading its legs, it stretched Ie broad skin flap that extended along the sides of its body, joining ont and back legs, and soared through the air.  la caught her breath as she watched the flying squirrel avoiding faes and trees. The bushy tail acted as a rudder, and by changing osition of its legs and tail, which changed the tension on the w membrane, the squirrel could steer clear of objects in its flight as it descended in a long, smooth curve. It was aiming for a tree (distance away and, when it drew near, it turned both its tail and up, and landed low on the trunk, then quickly scurried up. When ched some high branches, the furry little animal turned around limbed down again, headfirst, its outstretched hind claws stuck fae bark to anchor it. It looked around, then disappeared into a hole.

She felt /er across her shoulders and down her back, though it wasn't cold.

"I thought it might have been a bear," he said. "Especially these thick woods." me trees always grow near rivers, but I haven't seen trees like since I left the Clan. Isn't this a strange place for them to be?" is unusual. This place reminds me of the land of the Sharamudoi,  ^ but that's south of here, even south of those mountains we see to A west, and near Donau, the Great Mother River." Suddenly Ayla stopped where she was. Nudging Jondalar, she s lently pointed. At first he didn't see what had caught her attention then he noticed a slight movement of a foxy-red coat, and saw tk.  three-pronged antlers of a roe deer. The commotion and the smell of wolf had caused the small wary deer to freeze. It had stood without moving, hidden in the brush, waiting to see if there was anything tn fear from the predator. With the four-legged hunter gone, it had cau tiously begun to move away. Jondalar's spear and spear-thrower were still in his right hand. He raised it slowly, and taking aim, hurled the spear at the throat of the animal. The danger it feared had come from an unexpected direction. The hard-flung spear landed true. Even as it hit, the roe deer attempted to leap away, took a few bounding steps then crashed to the ground.  The flight of the squirrel and the unsuccessful sable were quickly forgotten. Jondalar crossed the distance to the roe deer in a few steps, with Ayla beside him. While Ayla turned the head, he knelt down beside the still struggling animal and slit its throat with his sharp blade to finish it off quickly and let it bleed. Then he stood up.  "Roe Deer, when your spirit returns to the Great Earth Mother, thank Her for giving us one of your kind, that we may eat," Jondalar said quietly.  Ayla, standing beside the man, nodded, then prepared to help him skin and butcher their dinner. , hate to leave the hide. Roe deer makes such soft leather," Ayla she put the last piece of meat in her parfleche, "and did you see on that sable?" t we don't have time to make leather, and we can't take much with us than we already have," Jondalar said. He was erecting pod of poles from which the parfleche full of meat would be ided.  now, but I still hate to leave it." y hung the parfleche; then Ayla glanced toward the fireplace, ig about the food she had just put on to cook, though nothing (parent.

"I wonder what someone would make of spoor like this," 1» grinning at the thought.  lat would you make of it?" Ayla asked. ^ "If Wolfs track was clear, I'd think a wolf was trailing two hr -- but in some places it's obvious that the horse prints are on top of"!  wolf prints, so he can't have been following. He was walking le them. That would confuse a tracker," he said. ' "Even if Wolfs prints were clear, I'd wonder why a wolf was foil ing these two horses. The tracks show they are both strong nj healthy, but look at the impression, how deep it is, and the set oftk!  hooves. You can tell they're carrying weight," Ayla said.  "That would confuse a tracker, too." "Oh, there they are," Ayla said, seeing the rather tall, soniewh straggling plants with light pink flowers and leaves shaped like snea points, that she had noticed earlier. With her digging stick she quicklv loosened several roots and pulled them out.  On their way back, she searched for a flat, hard stone or piece of wood, and a rounded stone to crush the soaproot and release the sa- ponin, which would foam into a light cleansing lather in the water. At a bend, upstream but not too far from their campsite, the small river had scoured out a waist-deep pool. The water was cool and refreshing and after washing, they explored the rocky river, swimming and wading farther upstream until they were stopped by a churning waterfall and swift rapids where the sloping sides of the valley narrowed and became steeper.  It reminded Ayla of the small river in her valley, with its fuming, churning waterfall blocking her way upstream, though the rest of the area made her think more of the mountain slopes around the cave where she grew up. There was a waterfall there that she remembered, a gentler, mossy one that had led her to a small cave she had claimed as her own, and that had more than once offered her a haven.  They let the current carry them back, splashing each other and laughing along the way. Ayla loved the sound ofjondalar's laughter.  Though he smiled, he didn't laugh often, tending instead to exhibit a more serious demeanor, but when he did, it was such a big, hearty, exuberant laugh, it came as a surprise.  When they got out and dried off, it was still warm. The dark cloud Ayla had noticed earlier was gone from the sky above them, but the sun was lowering toward a black and brooding mass languishing intn west, whose ponderous movement was emphasized by a ragged ^Y streaming swiftly beneath it in the other direction. Once the fire" dropped behind the somber clouds and banked above the weste ridge, it would cool off fast.

For a moment, she thought about objecting. It wasn't ry. He didn't have to comb her hair just because she had 1 his, but when he lifted her thick hair off her neck and pulled gh his fingers, like a caress, she acquiesced.  lair had a tendency to curl, and it tangled easily, but he worked y, freeing each snarl with very little pulling. Then he brushed r until it was smooth and nearly dry. She closed her eyes, a strange, shivery delight. Iza had combed her hair for her when a little girl, gently pulling out the tangles with a long, smooth, stick, but no man ever had. Jondalar's combing of her hair gave ntense feeling of being cared for and loved.  he discovered that he enjoyed combing and brushing her hair.  rk gold color reminded him of ripe grass, but with sun-bleached its that were nearly white. It was beautiful, and so thick and indling it was a sensuous pleasure that made him want more.  ie finished, he put the brush down, then lifted up the slightly i"esses, and, moving them aside, bent down to kiss her shoulders back of her neck.  kept her eyes closed, feeling the tingles caused by his warm and soft lips as he brushed them lightly over her skin.

But he wanted to wait wanted the exquisite pleasure it gave him to Pleasure her. He loved to do it, loved knowing he could. He would almost be willing to give uo his own Pleasure to Pleasure her... almost.  Hardly knowing how she got there, Ay la found herself on her back on top of their sleeping roll, with Jondalar stretched out beside her He kissed her. She opened her mouth a little, just enough to allow his tongue entrance, and put her arms around him. She loved the way it felt when his lips were firmly on hers, with his tongue gently exploring.  Then he pulled away and looked down at her.  "Woman, do you have any idea how much I love you?" She knew it was true. She could see it in his eyes, his brilliant, vivid, unbelievable blue eyes that caressed with their look, and even from a distance, could send shivers through her. His eyes expressed the emotions he tried so hard to keep under control. "I know how much I love you," Ayla said.  "I still can hardly believe it, that you are here with me, and not back at the Summer Meeting mated to Ranee." At the thought of how close he came to losing her to the charming, dark-skinned carver of ivory, he suddenly clutched her to him tightly with fierce need.  She held him, too, grateful that their long winter of misunderstanding had finally ended. She had sincerely loved Ranee--he was a good man and would have made a good mate--but he wasn't Jondalar, and her love for the tall man who was holding her in his arms was beyond anything she could explain.  His powerful dread of losing her eased, replaced, as he felt her warm body beside him, by a desire for her that was as strong. Suddenly h0 was kissing her neck and her shoulders and her breasts, as though be couldn't get enough of her.  Then he stopped and took a deep breath. He wanted to make it la^' and he wanted to use his skill to give her the best he could--and he was skilled. He had been taught by one who knew, and with more lovfi than she should have felt. He had wanted to please and had been more than willing to learn.

She felt him enter and raised up to meet him as he plunged in The embrace of her warm folds encircled him, and he penetrated deeply, feeling no fear that his size was more than she could hold. That was part of the wonder of her, that she matched him.  He pulled out, feeling the exquisite pleasure of the movement, and with complete abandon, plunged in again, deeply, while she raised up tight against him. He almost reached his peak, but the intensity backed down, and he pulled out again, then pushed in again, and again, and again, with each stroke building higher. Pulsing with the sensations of his movement, she felt the fullness of him, then his drawing back and filling her again, and was beyond feeling anything else.  She heard his strong breathing, and her own, as their cries mingled.  Then he cried out her name, she rose to meet him, and, with a great overflowing burst, they felt a release that matched the fiery sun in its glowing flame as it shot its last bright rays into the valley, and dropped behind the dark and rolling clouds, outlined in burnished gold.  After a few more strokes, he relaxed on top of her, feeling her rounded curves beneath him. She always loved that moment with him, the feeling of his weight on her. He never felt heavy; it was just a comfortable pressure and a closeness that warmed her while they rested.  Suddenly a warm tongue was licking her face, and a cold nose v/ss exploring their closeness. "Go away, Wolf," she said, shoving the animal away. "Go on, get out of here." "Wolf, go away!" Jondalar said harshly, adding his command, an pushing the cold wet nose away, but the mood was broken. As ne lifted off Ay la and rolled to his side, he felt a trifle annoyed, but be couldn't really be angry; he felt too wonderful for that.

It was a rich valley, reminding her of her childho'1 I with the Clan, but she didn't like the place. Something about it ma,i 3 her uneasy, and the feeling worsened with the coming of night Sh " was also feeling some fullness and a little backache, and she attributed her disquiet to the slight discomforts she occasionally experienced when her moon time was coming on. She wished she could go for a walk, activity usually helped, but it was already too dark.  She listened to the wind moaning as it sighed through the swavino willow trees, silhouetted against silvery clouds. The glowing ful] moon, encircled by a distinct halo, took turns hiding behind, then brilliantly illuminating the softly textured sky. Ayla decided some wil- lowbark tea might relieve her discomfort and quickly got up to cut some fresh. While she was at it, she decided to gather some flexible willow withes.  By the time their evening tea was ready and Jondalar joined her, the night air was damp and cold, cold enough for outer clothes. They sat close to the fire, glad to be sipping the hot tea. Wolf had hovered close to Ayla all evening, following her every step, but he seemed content to curl up by her feet when she sat near the warm flames, as though he'd done enough exploring that day. She picked up the thin, long willow twigs and began weaving with them.  "What are you making?" Jondalar asked.  "A head covering, to make a shade from the sun. It is getting very hot in the middle of the day," Ayla explained. She paused for a moment, then added, "I thought you might find use for one." "You are making that for me?" he said with a smile. "How did you know I was wishing I had something to shade the sun today?" "A woman of the Clan learns to anticipate the needs of her mate.  She smiled. "And you are my mate, aren't you?" He smiled back. "Without doubt, my woman of the Clan. And we'll announce it to all the Zeiandonii at the Matrimonial of the first Summer Meeting we join. But how can you anticipate needs? And why must Clan women learn that?" "It's not difficult. You just think about someone.

"Ayla, I want you to have a child, too, but n while we're traveling. Not until we're safely back. Not yet." "No, not yet," she said.  She worked quietly for a while, thinking about the son she had lefr behind with Uba, and about Rydag, who had been like her son in many ways. Both of them lost to her. Even Baby, who was in a strange way, like a son—at least, he was the first male animal she found and cared for—had left her. She would never see him again She looked at Wolf, suddenly worried that she might lose him, too I wonder, she thought, why is my totem taking all my sons away from me? I must be unlucky with sons.  "Jondalar, do your people have any special customs about wantinc children?" Ayla asked. "Women of the Clan are always supposed to want sons." "No, not really. I think men want a woman to bring sons to his hearth, but I think women like to have daughters first." "What would you like to have? Someday?" He turned to study her in the light of the fire. Something seemed to be bothering her. "Ayla, it doesn't matter to me. Whatever you want, or whatever the Mother gives you." Now it was her turn to study him. She wanted to be sure he really meant it. "Then I think I'm going to wish for a daughter. I don't want to lose any more children." Jondalar didn't quite know what she meant and didn't know how to respond. "I don't want you to lose any more children, either." They sat quietly while Ayla worked on the sun hats. Suddenly, he asked, "Ayla, what if you are right? What if children are not given by Doni? What if they are started by sharing Pleasures? You could have a baby starting inside you right now, and not even know it." "No, Jondalar. I don't think so. I think my moon time is coming on," she said, "and you know that means no babies have started.  She didn't usually like to talk about such personal matters with a man, but Jondalar had always been comfortable around her then, D01 like the Clan men. A woman of the Clan had to be especially careful not to look directly at a man when she was going through her woniai.  curse. But even if she wanted to, she couldn't exactly go into seclusio or avoid Jondalar while they were traveling, and she sensed that needed reassurance.

Above the cave, at the 9 ^ff, was a large, flattened boulder tilting over the edge, ready to fall.  Wnly she was deep in the cave, following a long, narrow passage. There was a light! A torch with its beckoning flame, and then another, and then sickening roar of an earthquake. A wolf howled. She felt a whirling, spinn,^ vertigo, and then Creb was inside her mind. "Get out!" he common/Sri "Hurry! Get out now!" ^1 She sat up with a start, throwing her sleeping furs off, and bolhJt for the tent opening. I "Ayla! What is it!" Jondalar said, grabbing her. I Suddenly a brilliant flash of light could be seen through the skin rf 1 the tent, and in a bright outline around the seams of the smoke-hok I flap, and the crack around the entrance left open for Wolf. It vy»g followed almost instantly by a loud, sharp boom. Ayla screamed and Wolf howled outside the tent.  "Ayla, Ayla. It's all right," the man said, holding her in his arms "It's just lightning and thunder." "We have to get out! He said to hurry. Get out now!" she said fumbling into her clothes. ] "Who said? We can't go out there. It dark, and it's raining." "Creb. In my dream. I had that dream again, with Creb. He said.  Come on, Jondalar! We have to hurry." "Ayla, calm down.

Creb told me to, and I can't stand this place," she said. "Please, Jondalar. Hurry." Tears were streaming down her face, though she was oblivious to them, as she piled things into pack baskets.  He decided he might as well. It was obvious she wasn't going to wait until morning, and he'd never get back to sleep now. He reached for his clothes while Ayla opened the entrance flap. The rain poured in as though someone had spilled it from a waterbag. She went outside and whistled, loud and long. It was followed by another wolf howl. After a wait, Ayla whistled again, then began tearing the tent stakes out of the ground.  She heard the hoofbeats of the horses and cried with relief to see them, though the salt of her tears was lost in the pouring deluge.

The mare sprang ahead in a fast gallo as though something were chasing her, as though, like Ayla, s couldn't wait to get away from there.

Dur.  ing the era, extensive movements of the earth were uplifting the land.  raising the level of the small inland sea to the south, and openino passageways to an even larger sea farther south. Within recent decades.i the uplift had closed off the valley, forming a shallow basin, which had!  been filled by the river, creating a small lake behind the natural dam. i But an outlet had broken through a few years before and drained the I small reservoir of water, leaving in its wake moisture enough for a wooded valley in the middle of the dry steppes.  A second mudslide, farther downstream, had dammed the outlet channel again, containing the raging floodwaters within the confines of the valley and causing a backwash. Jondalar thought the scene below must have come from some nightmare. He could hardly believe what he had seen. The entire valley was a wild, turbulent, frenzied slimy of mud and rocks, sloshing back and forth, churning brush and whole trees torn out by their roots, and splintered by the battering.  No living thing could have survived in that place, and he shuddered to think what would have happened if Ayla hadn't wakened and insisted that they leave. He doubted if they would have made it to safety without the horses. He glanced around; they were both standing with heads down, feet apart, looking as exhausted as he thought they must be. Wolf was beside Ayla, and when he saw Jondalar look his way be lifted his head straight up and howled. The man had a fleeting memory of a wolf howl disturbing his sleep, just before Ayla woke up.  Another lightning bolt flashed, and at the sound of the thunder, be felt Ayla shiver violently in his arms.

It was a haphazard construction, but for now they ' wanted shelter from the rain.  They brought their pack baskets and other things into the inakesh'i.1 shelter, tore leaves off the trees to line the wet ground, and spread I their damp sleeping furs. Then they took off their outer clothes helrw^ii- each other wring out the soaked leather, and draped them on branch 1 Finally, shivering hard, they huddled down and pulled their sleenim!  furs around them. Wolf came in and shook himself vigorously sunn8 ing water, but everything was so wet that it hardly mattered. Th» steppe horses, with their thick shaggy coats, much preferred cold dry winter to the drenching summer storm, but they were used to livino outside. They stood close together beside the stand of brushy growth and let the rain pour over them.  Within the damp shelter, too wet to even consider a fire, Ayla and Jondalar, wrapped in heavy furs, cuddled close together. Wolf curled up on top of their sleeping furs, pressing close to them, and finally their combined body heat warmed them. The woman and man dozed a bit, though neither of them slept much. Near dawn the rain slacked off, and their sleep deepened.    Ayla listened, smiling to herself, before opening her eyes. Within the medley of birdsong that had awakened her, she could distinguish the sharp elaborate call notes of a pipet. Then she heard a melodious warble that seemed to be getting louder, but when she tried to find the source of the trilling song, she had to look carefully to see the drab, brown, inconspicuous little skylark just landing. Ayla rolled on her side to watch him.  The skylark walked along the ground easily and quickly, well- balanced by its large hind claws, then bobbed its crested head and came up with a caterpillar in its beak. With quick, jerky steps, it rushed toward a bare scrape in the ground near the stems of a sallow bush, where a camouflaged cluster of newly hatched fluffy chicks suddenly sprang to life, each open mouth begging to be filled with the delectable morsel. Soon a second bird, similar in markings though slightly more drab, and nearly invisible against the dun earth of the steppes, sp" peared with a winged insect. While she stuffed it into an open mouth, the first bird leaped into the air and climbed in circles until he w almost lost from view. But his presence was not lost. He had disap- peared into a spiral of incredibly glorious song.  Ayla softly whistled the musical call, replicating the sounds wi such precision that the mother bird stopped pecking at the ground ^ search of food and turned in her direction. Ayla whistled again, wl '  jie grain to offer, as she had done when she lived in her ilirst began imitating bird calls.

Sandgrouse were big ake a decent meal, and so were those cooing turtledoves, looking around to see if she could spot the buxom birds ed the brown sandgrouse in general size and shape.

She leaned over and rinsed her hands, drank wpped handfuls of the cool running liquid, and then hurried peir sleeping place. Jondalar was up, and he smiled when she  made her way into their shelter within the sallow brush to get her pack baskets. She pulled it out in the open and began runm through it. Jondalar brought both of his baskets out with him went back for the rest of their things. He wanted to see how' damage had been done by the soaking rains. Wolf came lopine just then and went straight to Ayla.  "You're looking satisfied with yourself," she said, roughing no k| neck fur, so thick and full it was almost a mane. When she stopped kj jumped up on her, putting his muddy paws on her chest, nearly attril level of her shoulders. He caught her by surprise, almost knocking h.^ down, but she recovered her balance.  "Wolf! Look at all this mud," she said, as he reached to lick hw throat and face, and then, with a low rumbling growl, he opened hit mouth and took her jaw in his teeth. But for all his impressive canim armaments, his action was as restrained and gentle as if he'd bew handling a new puppy. No tooth broke skin; they hardly made aa impression on it. She buried both her hands in his ruff again, pushed his head back, and looked at the devotion in his wolfish eyes with as much affection as he showed her. Then she grabbed his jaw with her' teeth, and gave him the same kind of growling, gentle love-bite back.  "Now, get down, Wolf. Look at the mess you've made of me! I'm going to have to wash this, too." She brushed off the loose, sleeveless leather tunic she wore over the short leggings that had been used as undergarments.  "If I didn't know better, Ayla, I could almost be frightened for you when he does that," Jondalar said. "He's gotten so big, and he is a hunter. He could kill someone." "You don't have to worry about Wolf when he does that. That's the way wolves greet each other and show their love. I think he's glad we woke up in time to get out of the valley, too." "Have you looked down there?" "Not yet... Wolf, get away from there," she said, pushing him away when he began to sniff between her legs. "It's my moon time.  She looked aside and flushed slightly. "I came to get my wool, and I haven't had the chance to look." While Ayla attended to her personal needs, washing herself and her clothes in the little stream, tying on the straps that held the wool® place, and getting something else to wear, Jondalar walked toward w" edge of the valley to pass his water and looked down. There was sign of a campsite, or of any place there could be one. The natl1" basin of the valley was partially filled with water, and the logs trees and other floating debris were bobbing and dipping as the agit^ i »„ ^se.

I just started thinking about what would happen if we vyp downstream of that valley, and remembered last night. And then t thought about losing you, and..." He tightened his arms around her "Ayla, I don't know what I would do if I ever lost you," he said with sudden fervor, holding her to him. "I'm not sure I'd want to go on i.. 0 U living.  She felt a tinge of worry at his strong reaction. "I hope you would go on living, Jondalar, and find someone else to love. If anything ever happened to you, a piece of me, of my spirit, would be gone with you because I love you, but I would go on living, and a piece of your spirit would always be living with me." "It wouldn't be easy to find someone else to love. I didn't think I'd ever find you. I don't know if I'd even want to look," Jondalar said.  They started back, walking together. Ayla was quiet for a while, thinking, then said, "I wonder if that's what happens when you love someone, and that person loves you back? I wonder if you exchange pieces of each other's spirit. Maybe that's why it hurts so much to lose someone you love." She paused, then continued. "It's like the men of the Clan. They are hunting brothers, and they exchange a piece of each other's spirit, particularly when one saves the other's life. It's not easy to go on living when a piece of your spirit is missing, and each hunter knows a piece of himself will go to the next world if the other goes, so he will watch and protect his brother, do almost anything to save his life." She stopped and looked up at him. "Do you think we have exchanged pieces of our spirits, Jondalar? We are hunting partners, aren't we?" "And you once saved my life, but you are much more than a hunting brother," he said, smiling at the idea. "I love you. I understand now why Thonolan didn't want to go on living when Jetamio died. Some" times I think he was searching for a way into the next world, so could find them, Jetamio and the baby who was never born." "But if anything ever happened to me, I wouldn't want you to foil.  me to any spirit world. I'd want you to stay right here, and someone else," Ayla said, with conviction. She didn't like all t11.  about next worlds. She wasn't sure what some other world after one would be like, or even, deep in her heart, if one really exl ^ What she did know was that to get to any next world, you had in this one, and she didn't want to hear about Jondalar dying' e a before or after she did. ine about worlds of the spirit led to other random thoughts.  that's what happens when you get old," she said.

"What?" Ayla said, looking upset.  "Your parfleche, and the long poles." She shut her eyes and shook her head in dismay. "Oh, no. Thati a good meat-keeper and it was full of roe deer meat. And those po!  They were just the right size. It's going to be hard to replace them.  better see if anything else was lost and make sure the emergency fi is all right." She reached for the pack basket where she kept the few perso things she was taking with her and the clothing and equipment t would be used later. Though all the baskets were wet, and saggi the spare ropes and cords on the bottom had kept the contents of < one reasonably dry and undamaged. The food they were using al< the way was near the top of the basket; below it the emergency tra' ing-food package was still securely wrapped and essentially dry. ' decided this might be a good time to look over all their supplies )US be certain nothing was spoiled, and to judge how long the food tl had with them would last.  She took out all the various kinds of dried preserved food she brought with them and spread it out on top of their sleeping roll. 1 were berries--blackberries, raspberries, bilberries, elderberries, berries, strawberries, alone or mixed together--that had been m" and dried into cakes. Other sweet varieties were cooked down, dried to a leathery texture, sometimes with added pieces of sma apples, tart but high in pectin. Whole berries and wild appi05' with other fruits such as wild pears and plums, were sliced whole, and sweetened a bit as they dried in the sun. Any of them is they were, or soaked or cooked with water, and were often avor soups or meats. There also were grains and seeds, some been partially cooked and then parched; some shelled and azelnuts; and the stone-pine cones full of rich nuts she had from the valley the day before.  ibles were also dried--stems, buds, and particularly starchy ch as cattail, thistle, licorish fern, and various lily conns.  ;re steam-cooked in ground ovens before being dried, but ere dug, peeled, and strung immediately on cords made of tv bark of certain plants or sinew from the backbone or leg of various animals.

The animals themselves "I evolved differences in diets and migratory patterns, spatial separati-l and seasonal variations, which all contributed to the wealth of life a!  in later times on the great equatorial plains far to the south-the o 1.J place that came close to matching the profound richness of the Ice A^ steppes--the great abundance and variety of animals shared the on" ductive land in complex and mutually sustaining ways.  Some specialized in eating particular plants, some in particular pan!  of plants; some grazed the same plants at slightly different stages of development; some fed in places that others did not go, or they feU lowed later, or migrated differently. The diversity was maintained because eating and living habits of one species fit in between or around^ those of another in complementary niches.  Woolly mammoths needed great quantities of fibrous filler, rouA grasses, stems, and sedges, and because they tended to bog down in deep snows, marshes or sphagnum meadows, they kept to the firm,; windswept ground near the glaciers. They made long migrations along the wall of ice, moving south only in spring and summer.  Steppe horses also required bulk; like mammoths, they digested coarse stems and grasses quickly, but were somewhat more selective, preferring the mid-height varieties of grass. They could dig down through snow to find feed, but this used up more energy than they gained, and it was a struggle for them to travel when snow piled up.  They could not subsist for long in deep snow and preferred the hard- surfaced, windy plains.  Unlike mammoths and horses, bison needed the leaves and sheaths of grass for the higher protein content and tended to select shortgrass, utilizing the areas of mid- and tallgrass only for new growth, usually in spring. In summer, however, an important, if inadvertent, cooperation was practiced. Horses used their teeth like clippers to bite through the tough stalks. After the horses had passed by, cutting down the stems, the densely rooted grass was stimulated to send out ne leaves ofregrowth. The migrations of horses were often followed, an an interval of a few days, by the gigantic bison, who welcomed new shoots, i In winter, bison moved to southern ranges of variable weather more snow, which kept low-growing grass leaves moist and are  northern plains.

They were fast tee runners that could outdistance their predators only on vel surfaces of the windy steppes. Mouflon, the wild sheep, ter hand, were expert climbers and used steep terrain to it they could not dig through snow that piled up. They ji the windblown rocky high ground.  (catlike species related to mouflon, chamois and ibex, divided Ige by altitude, or by differences of terrain and landscape, with Igoat-antelope, ibex, taking the highest ground with the steeply followed at slightly lower elevations by the smaller and very thamois, with the mouflon below them. But they were all |k rough terrain of even the lowest levels of the arid steppes, By were adapted to cold, so long as it was dry.  »oxen were also goatlike animals, although larger, and their Mible coats, which resembled the fur of mammoths and woolly (OSes, made them seem bigger and more "oxiike." They nibbled lusly on the low shrubs and sedges, and they were particularly to the coldest regions, preferring the extremely cold, windy, Uns close to the glacier. Though their underwool was shed in ', musk-oxen became stressed if the weather turned too warm.  ; deer and reindeer kept to open ground in herds, but most !er were browsers of tree leaves. The solitary woodland moose Fe- 1 hey loved the summer leaves of deciduous trees, and the tt Pondweeds and water plants of marshes and lakes, and with °oves and long legs, they could negotiate marshy, boggy got-  tomlands. In winter they survived on the more indigestible grass high willow twigs of trees that grew on the low ground of river vail their splay-footed long legs easily carrying them through the w blown snow that drifted and piled up there.  Reindeer were winter-loving animals, feeding on lichens that p on barren soil and rocks. They could smell the favored plants through snow, from a long distance, and their hooves were adaote digging down through deep snows if they needed to. In summer t ate both grass and leafy shrubs.  Elk and reindeer both preferred alpine meadows or herbaceous K lands during spring and summer, but below the elevation of the rs ing sheep, and the elk tended to eat grasses more than shrubs. A and onagers invariably preferred the arid higher hills, while bi ranged a bit lower, though they generally climbed higher than hor which had a broader choice of terrain than mammoths or rhii eroses.  Those primal plains with their complex and diverse grasslands; tained in great multitudes a fantastic mixture of animals. No sil place on a later earth did more than approximate parts of it. The ( cold environment of high mountains could not compare, though d were similarities. Mountain-dwelling sheep, goats, and antelopes tended their range to the lower ground then, but large herds of pi animals could not exist in the steep, rocky terrain of high mount when the climate of the lowlands changed.  The soggy and fragile northern bogs were not the same. They v too wet for much grass to grow, and their stinting, acid soils cai plants to develop toxins to avoid being grazed by the great multitu.  which would destroy such delicate slow-growing flora. The vane were limited and offered poor nutrients for the diversity of large h( ing animals; there was not sufficient feed. And only those with v splaying hooves, like reindeer, could live there. Huge creatures ofg weight with large stumpy legs, or fast runners with narrow da) hooves became mired in the soft, wet land. They needed firm, < solid ground.  Later, the grassy plains of warmer, more temperate regions de oped distinct bands of more limited vegetation controlled by temp ture and climate. They offered too little diversity in summer, ^w much snow in winter. Snow also bogged down animals that requ1 firm ground, and it was difficult for many to push aside to reach Deer could live in woods where the snow was deep, but only De^ they browsed leaves and twig tips from trees that grew above the s reindeer could dig through snow to reach the lichen on which they in winter. Bison and aurochs subsisted, but they were reduced i0 r their full potential. Other animals, such as horses, aber as their preferred environment shrunk.  .jaue combination of all the many elements of the Ice at fostered the magnificent multitudes, and each was line the bitter cold, the withering winds, and the ice en the vast glaciers shrank back to polar regions and m the lower latitudes, so, too, did the great herds and i become dwarfed or disappear entirely from a land that j land that could no longer sustain them.

As they rode downstream, looking over the situation, Ayla norii a stand of tall, slender birches growing near the water. The place I such a familiar feeling that she half expected to see the long, semis) terranean earthlodge of the Lion Camp tucked into the side of the sk at the back of a river terrace, with grass growing out of the sides rounded top, and the perfectly symmetrical arched entrance that t so surprised her when she first saw it. But when she actually saw si an arch, it gave her an eerie, spine-tingling shock.  "Jondalar! Look!" He looked up the slope where she was pointing. There he saw i just one, but several, perfectly symmetrical archways, each an entrai to a circular, dome-shaped structure. They both dismounted and, fh ing the path up from the river, climbed to the Camp.  Ayla was surprised at how eager she was to meet the people v lived there, and realized how long it had been since they had seen spoken to anyone besides each other. But the place was empty, a planted in the ground between the two curved mammoth tusks will tips were joined together at the top, forming the arched entrance one of the dwellings, was a small carved ivory figure of a female w ample breasts and hips.

It's not one big earthlodge that everyone lives in like ip," Jondalar said, looking at the group of seven round dwell- red with a smooth layer of hardened earth and river clay.  an a single, large, multifamily longhouse, like the one they in during the winter, this place had several smaller dwellings together, but the purpose was the same. It was a settlement, ttity of more-or-less related families.  :.s like Wolf Camp, where the Summer Meeting was," Ayla ping in front of the entrance of one of the small dwellings, reluctant to push the heavy drape aside and enter the home ers without being invited, in spite of generally understood hat had developed out of a mutual necessity for the sake of n time of need.  of the younger people at the Summer Meeting thought the s were old-fashioned," Jondalar said. "They liked the idea of lual lodge for just one or two families." ttean they wanted to live by themselves? Just one lodge with o families? For a winter Camp?" Ayla asked.  he said. "No one wanted to live alone all winter. You never tte of these small lodges by itself; there are always at least five inetimes more. That was the idea. The people I talked to 1 was easier to build a smaller lodge for a new family or two, than to crowd into one big lodge until they had to build another they wanted to build near their families, and stay with their Ca and share in the activities and the food that everyone worked too to collect and store for winter." He pushed aside the heavy skin hanging from the joined tusk's formed the entrance, ducked under it and stepped inside. Avia < back, holding up the drape to shed some light.  "What do you think, Ayla? Does it look like a Mamutoi lodge1'' "It could be. It's hard to tell. Remember that Sungaea Camn stopped at on the way to the Summer Meeting? It wasn't very differ»3 from a Mamutoi Camp. Their customs may have been a little differe but they were like the Mammoth Hunters in many ways. Mamut a even the funeral ceremony was very similar. He thought they w< once related to Mamutoi. I did notice the patterns of their decoratk were not the same, though." She paused, trying to think of od differences. "And some of their clothes--like that beautiful shouh blanket made out of mammoth and other wools on the girl who h died. But even Mamutoi Camps have different patterns. Nezzie alws knew what Camp someone was from just by the small changes in I style and shape of the patterns on their tunics, even when I coul' see very much difference at all." With the light coming in from the entrance, the main suppor construction was plain to see. The lodge was not framed with woodj| although a few of the birch poles were strategically placed; it had be built out of mammoth bones. The large sturdy bones of the huge bea; were the most abundant and accessible building material available i the essentially treeless steppes.  Most of the mammoth bones used for building material did not coi from animals that had been hunted and killed for that purpose. They were from animals that had died of natural causes, gathered fro® wherever they happened to fall on the steppes or, most often, from accumulated piles that had been swept up by flooding rivers and deposited at certain bends or barriers in the river, like driftwood. Ptf" manent winter shelters were often built on river terraces near suctt piles, because mammoth bones and tusks were heavy.  It usually took several individuals to lift a single bone and no wanted to carry them very far; the total weight of the mammoth bo0® that were used to construct one small dwelling was two or three tn sand pounds or more. Building such shelters was not the activity single family, but a community effort, directed by someone ^ knowledge and experience, and organized by someone with the a ^ to persuade others to help.  called a Camp was a settled village, and the people were not nomadic followers of the itinerant game, but ntary hunters and gatherers.

Ijfo in, Jondalar! Wolf! Stay!" she commanded, making the |er hand as well.  yit, Ayla?" Jondalar said.  Du smell it? There's an animal in there, something that can &ng smell, a badger, I think, and if we scare it, it will make tink that lingers. We won't be able to use this lodge, and the (> live here will have trouble getting rid of the smell. Maybe I the drape back, Jondalar, it will come out by itself.

But like most members of family, the badger could spray an attacker with the power- g and acrid contents of its anal glands. The last thing Ayla is to be around a wolf that stunk of that strong musky odor, isn't sure how long she could hold Wolf back. If the badger  didn't come out soon, she might have to use a more drastic way to -.1 the lodge of the animal.  The badger did not see well with its small and inconspicuous ev but they were watching the lighted opening with unwavering atr ' tion. When it seemed obvious the badger was not going to leave <ili reached up for the sling that was wrapped around her head, and ini the pouch hanging from her waist for stones. Ayla put a stone in the bulging pocket of the sling, took aim on the reflecting points of light and with a quick and expert spin to gain momentum, hurled the stone She heard a thud, and the two small lights went out.  "I think you got him, Ayla!" Jondalar said, but they waited a while to make sure there was no movement before entering the lodge.  When they did, they were aghast. The rather large animal, three feet from tip of nose to end of tail, was sprawled on the ground with a bloody wound on its head, but it had quite obviously spent some time within the dwelling, destructively exploring everything it could find.  The place was a shambles! The hard-packed earthen floor was scratched up and pits had been dug in it, some containing the animal's waste. The woven mats that had covered the floor were torn to shreds, along with various woven containers. Hides and furs on the raised bed- platforms were chewed and ripped apart, and the stuffing of feathers, wools, or grasses of bed padding were strewn over all. Even a portion of the densely compacted wall had been dug out; the badger had made its own entrance.  "Look at this! I would hate to return and find something like this," Ayla said.  "That's always a danger when you leave a place empty. The Mother doesn't protect a lodge from Her other creatures. Her children must appeal to the spirit animal directly and deal with the animals of this world themselves," Jondalar said. "Maybe we can clean this lodge up.  little for them, even if we can't repair all the damage." "I'm going to skin that badger and leave it for them, so they kn0^ what caused all this. They should be able to use the hide, anyway.  Ayla said, picking the animal up by the tail to take it outside.  In better light, she noted the gray back with its stiff guard hairs^tt.  darker underparts, and the distinctive black-and-white striped verifying that it was, indeed, a badger. She slit its throat with a sWf flint knife and left it to bleed out. Then she went back to the eww lodge, pausing for a moment before she went in to look around a rest of the domed dwellings nearby. She tried to visualize w would be like with people, and she felt a strong pang of regre they were gone. It could be very lonely without other people a ly felt very grateful for Jondalar, and for a moment she was overwhelmed by the love she felt for him.  reached for the amulet around her neck, felt the comforting inside the decorated leather bag, and thought of her totem.  jn't think of her Cave Lion protecting spirit as much as she ad. It was a Clan spirit, though Mamut had said her totem always be with her. Jondalar always referred to the Great Aether when he talked about the spirit world, and she thought Mother more now, since the training she had been receiving Aamut, but she always felt it was her Cave Lion who had t Jondalar to her, and she felt moved to communicate with an spirit.  g the ancient sacred language of silent hand signs that was used ess the spirit world, and to communicate with other clans whose Aen everyday words and more common hand signs were differ- ?la closed her eyes and directed her thoughts to her totem.  at Spirit of Cave Lion," she gestured, "this woman is grateful wind worthy; grateful to be chosen by the powerful Cave Lion.  og-ur always told this woman that a powerful spirit was difficult with, but it was always worth it.

"You ? • •. occupied," he said. "I didn't want to disturb you." te •.. thinking about my totem, my Cave Lion," she said, "and '^ne. I hope he will be... comfortable there." "The spirit animals are all comfortable near Doni. The Great Mother created and gave birth to all of them. The legends tell.  it," he said.  "Legends? Stories about the times before?" "I guess you could say they were stories, but they are told ' " certain way." ' "There were Clan legends, too. I used to love it when Dorv them. Mog-ur named my son after one of my favorites, 'The Lee ofDurc,'"Aylasaid. c Jondalar felt a moment of surprise and a twinge of disbelief at th.1 thought that the people of the Clan, the flatheads, could have legend.  and stories. It was still difficult for him to overcome certain ingrainal3 ideas he had grown up with, but he had already been made aware thtfl they were much more complex than he would have thought possit why couldn't they have had legends and stories, too?  "Do you know any Earth Mother legends?" Ayla asked.  "Well, I think I remember part of one. They are told in a way i make them easier to remember, but only special zeiandonia know tt all." He paused to remember, then began in a chanting singsong: "Her birth waters gushed, filling rivers and seas, Then flooded the land and gave rise to the trees.  From each drop that spilled, new grass and leaves grew Till sprouting green plants filled all the earth's view." Ayla smiled. "That's wonderful, Jondalar! It tells the story withlj nice feeling, and a nice sound, something like the rhythms of the| Mamutoi songs. It would be very easy to remember that." ] "It is often sung. Different people sometimes make different song»| for it, but the words mostly stay the same. Some people can sing the whole story, with all the legends." "Do you know any more?" "A little. I've heard it all, and generally know the story, but the verses are long, a lot to remember. The first part is about Doni wb% lonely and giving birth to the sun, Ball, 'the Mother's great joy, bright shining boy,' then they tell how She loses him and becomes lonely again. The moon is Her lover, Lumi, but She created him,t00, That story is more of a woman's legend; it's about moon times, an"j becoming a woman. There are other legends about Her giving ^lrtn | all the spirit animals, and to the spirit woman and man, to all ofE3"" | Children." ^| Wolf barked then, an attention-getting puppy bark that he i° j did accomplish his aim, encouraging him to keep it beyond the P"'17!  stage. They both looked in his direction and then saw the cause o  ow on the sparsely wooded, grassy floodplain of the Isinall herd of aurochs were straggling by. The wild cattle ch massive horns and shaggy coats, mostly of a solid > deep it was almost black. But among the herd were a ds that sported large white spots, primarily around the larters, mild genetic aberrations that showed up occa- ilarly among aurochs.  ; same moment, Ayla and Jondalar looked at each other, r a knowing nod, then called their horses. Quickly re- ;k baskets, which they took inside the dwelling, and iar-throwers and spears, they mounted and headed to- As they neared the grazing herd, Jondalar stopped to don and decide upon the best approach. Ayla halted as f his lead. She knew carnivorous animals, particularly ;s, although animals as large as lynx and the massively hyena had been among her prey, and a lion had once , and now a wolf, but she was not as familiar with the owsers that were normally hunted for food. Though she r own ways to hunt them when she lived alone, Jondalar »hunting them and had much more experience.  ause she had been in a mood to communicate with her ; world of the spirits, Ayla was in a strange state of mind i the herd. It seemed almost too coincidental that, just ikad decided that the Mother would not object if they stayed I'to replenish their losses and hunt for an animal with a Ie and plenty of meat, suddenly a herd of aurochs should (ria wondered if it was a sign, from the Mother or, maybe, Mem, that they had been guided there.  lot so unusual, however. All through the year, especially I ivarmer seasons, various animals, in herds or singly, mi- BUgh the gallery forests and lush grasslands of large river t.:wy particular site along a major river, it was usual to see s <rf animal wander along at least every few days, and in terns whole processions passed by daily.

"The Be white on its face and across the left shoulder?" he said.  We should try for her," Jondalar said. "She's full grown, but »» of her horns, she doesn't look too old, and she's off by ^a chill of recognition. Now she was convinced it was a sign.    K 131 Jondalar had chosen the unusual animal! The one with the white Whenever she had been faced with difficult choices in her life' after much thought had finally reasoned, or rationalized, her }vav '^w^ decision, her totem had confirmed that it was the correct one by shn l1 ing her a sign, an unusual object of some sort. When she was a iriri 1 Creb had explained such signs to her and told her to keep themf good luck. Most of the small objects that she carried in the decoratwl pouch around her neck were signs from her totem. The sudden an.  pearance of the aurochs herd, after they had made their decision to stay, and Jondalar's decision to hunt the unusual one, seemed straneelv akin to signs from a totem.  Though their decision to stay at this Camp had not been an agonic ingly personal one, it was an important one that had required serious thought. This was the permanent winter home of a group of people who had invoked the power of the Mother to guard it in their absence.  While the needs of survival did allow a passing stranger to use it in case of necessity, it had to be with legitimate reason. One did not incur the possible wrath of the Mother lightly.  The earth was richly populated with living creatures. In their travels they had seen uncounted numbers of a great variety of animals, but few people. In a world so empty of human life, there was comfort in the thought that an invisible realm of spirits was aware of their existence, cared about their actions, and perhaps directed their steps. Even a stem or inimical spirit who cared enough to demand certain actions of appeasement was better than the heartless disregard of a harsh and indifferent world, in which their lives were entirely in their own hands, with no one else to turn to in time of need, not even in their thoughts.  Ayla had come to the conclusion that if their hunt was successful, it would mean that it was all right for them to use the Camp, but if they failed, they would have to go. They had been shown the sign, the unusual animal, and to gain good luck they must keep a part of it. u they could not, if their hunt was unsuccessful, it would mean bad luck, a sign that the Mother did not want them to stay, and that they should leave immediately. The young woman wondered what the outcome would be.    u? f- y.'-  I studied the disposition of the aurochs herd along the fettle were spread out between the bottom of the slope and he water among various small pastures of rich green grass, interspersed with brush and trees.

"If you ride along t those reeds and cattails, and I come up on her through in the alder brush, we'll have her between us and can ride ed over the situation and nodded agreement. Then she "I want to tie down my spear holder before we start," she ig the long, tube-shaped rawhide container to the straps the riding blanket of soft deerskin. Inside the stiff leather several well-made, graceful spears with slender round ground and polished to a fine sharpness and split at the they were attached to the long wooden shafts.

The greater length increased leverage and momentum, w in turn increased the power and distance of the flight of the spear.  Hurling a spear with a spear-thrower was similar to throwing i hand; the difference was in the results. With it, the long shaft wid sharp point could be propelled more than twice as far as a spear thi by hand, with many times the force.  Jondalar's invention utilized mechanical advantage to transmit amplify the force of muscle power, but it wasn't the first impleme use those principles. His people had a tradition of creative invd and had utilized similar ideas in other ways. For example, a sharp ] of flint held in the hand was an effective cutting tool, but attach handle to it gave the user an extraordinary increase in force and trol. The seemingly simple idea of putting handles on things--kn axes, adzes, and other carving, cutting, and drilling tools, a longei on shovels and rakes, and even a form of detachable handle to thr spear--multiplied their effectiveness many times. It was not )i simple idea, it was an important invention that made work easier survival more probable.  Though the ones who had come before them had slowly deve and improved various implements and tools, the people like Jo" and Ayla were the first to imagine and innovate to such an exti^ degree. Their brains could make abstractions easily. They were ble of conceiving of an idea and planning how to implement it.  mple objects that utilized advanced principles that were nderstood, they drew conclusions and applied them in istances. They did more than invent usable tools, they nee. And from the same wellspring of creativity, utilizing wer to abstract, they were the first people to see the world in symbolic form, to extract its essence and reproduce it; edart.  a finished tying down her holder, she remounted. Then, mdalar had a spear in readiness, she also placed a spear on rower and, holding them easily but carefully, started in l Jondalar had indicated.

Jondalar looked beyond the animals and f annoyance that approached real anger. Wolf had arrived, aoving toward the cattle with his tongue lolling out, man- both menacing and playful at the same time. Ayla hadn't yet, and Jondalar had to stifle an urge to shout to her and ill him off. But a shout would only startle the cows and them off at a run.

Though he did have a basic understanding of of the Clan, Jondalar wasn't thinking of gestures as lan- W and didn't recognize her signs. He was concentrating Ivage a deteriorating situation. The cows had begun low-  ing, and the calf, sensing fear from them, began bawling. Th ^ looked ready to break away. What had started out to be almost n'2 conditions for an easy kill was rapidly becoming a losing effort.

They raced after it, but as they clo»«l in, the cow suddenly dodged and doubled back, dashing between both t| horses toward the trees at the opposite end of the meadow.  ;;; Ayla shifted her weight, and Whinney quickly changed direction^ it; The mare was accustomed to quick changes. Ayla had hunted from.  ^ horseback before, though usually it was for smaller animals that wesc "? downed with her sling. Jondalar had more trouble. A guiding reak ^ wasn't as quick a command as a shift in body weight, and the man ami his young stallion had far less experience hunting together, but aftw || & some initial hesitation they were soon pounding after the white-spotted!  g:t;i aurochs as well.  &^! The cow was heading at a dead run for the grove of trees and thick |) ji brush ahead. If she made it to cover, it would be difficult to follow her through it, and there was a good chance that she could get away. Ayte on Whinney and, behind them, Jondalar riding Racer were gaining oh the aurochs, but all grazing animals depended on speed to escape predators, and wild cattle could be nearly as fleet as horses when pressed.  Jondalar urged Racer on, and the horse responded with an all-out burst of speed. Trying to steady his spear so he could make an attempt to get the fleeing animal, Jondalar pulled up alongside Ayla, then surged ahead, but at a subtle signal from the woman, the mare kept pace. Ayla held her spear ready to hurl as well, but even at a gallop she rode with an easy, effortless grace that was the result of practice, and her initial training of the horse that had been unintentional, bnc felt that many of her signals to the horse were more an extension oi thought than an act of guidance. She had only to think of how ano where she wanted the mare to go, and Whinney complied. They 'w> such an intimate understanding of each other, she hardly realized v^ the subtle movements of her body that accompanied the thought given a signal to the sensitive and intelligent animal..^ As Ayla was taking aim with her spear, suddenly Wolf w^ ra"' alongside the fleeing cow.

I tried call him away, but I didn't want to shout and drive them now what you wanted. Why didn't you tell me in Clan asking you, but you weren't paying attention," Ayla said.  ? Jondalar thought. It hadn't occurred to him that she was tnguage. That would be a good way to signal. Then he 'd. "I doubt if it would have done any good," he said. "He aldn't have stopped even if you had tried to call him." >t, but I think Wolf could learn to be a help. He already >h small game. Baby learned to hunt with me. He was a ? partner. If a cave lion can learn to hunt with people,  Wolf could, too," Ayla said, feeling defensive about him.  they had killed the aurochs, and Wolf did help.  Jondalar thought Ayla's judgment of the skills a wolf was c learning was unrealistic, but there was no point in arguing She treated the animal like a child, as it was, and it would o her defend him more.  "Well, we'd better gut this cow before it starts to swell. An have to skin it out here and divide it into pieces so we can pack; the Camp," Jondalar said, and then another problem occurred i "But what are we going to do about that wolf?" "What about Wolf?" Ayla asked.  "If we cut that aurochs into pieces and carry part of it up Camp, he'll be able to eat the meat left here," the man said, hi; tion rising, "and when we come back here to get more, he'll be get to the meat we brought up to the Camp.

He was exasperated with the problems 1 ceived the wolf to be causing and was not thinking clearly.  But he made Ayla angry. Maybe Wolf would go after the i she wasn't there, but he wouldn't touch it as long as she was wit She would just make sure Wolf stayed with her. He wasn't that mu of a problem. Why was Jondalar picking on him so much? She i to answer him, then changed her mind and whistled for Wh With a smooth bound, she mounted, then turned back to Jor "Don't worry about it. I'll get that cow up to the Camp," she • she rode away, calling Wolf to her.  She rode hard back to the earthlodge, jumped down and h inside, and came out with a stone axe with a short handle, one Jo had made for her. Then she mounted again and urged Whinney t the birch woods.  Jondalar watched her ride up and saw her coming back down •• into the woods, wondering what she was planning. He had start belly cut to remove the intestines and stomach of the cow, but 1 having mixed feelings as he worked. He did think he was just his concerns about the young wolf, but he was sorry he had l them up to Ayla. He knew how she felt about the animal.

"You said something about using Clan signs when we don' want to shout. That could be useful." As Ayla went to look for anothor tree of the right shape and size, she was smiling.  Jondalar examined the tree she had been working on to see how much more chopping it would need. It was difficult to cut down a hard tree with a stone axe. The brittle flint of the axe head was made rather thick so that it would not break too easily from the force of the blow and a strike did not cut in deeply, but instead chipped a little away.  The tree looked more as if it had been gnawed than cut. Ayla listened to the rhythmic sound of stone hitting wood as she carefully examined the trees in the grove. When she found one that was suitable, she notched the bark then looked for a third.  When the necessary trees were cut down, they dragged them out to the clearing and, using knives and the axe, stripped the branches, then lined them up on the ground. Ayla judged the size and marked them, and they cut them all to an equal length. While Jondalar removed the internal organs from the aurochs, she walked back to the lodge for ropes and a device she had made of leather straps and thongs knotted and braided together. She brought along one of the torn floor mats as well when she returned, then signaled for Whinney and adjusted the special harness on her.  Using two of the long poles--the third was only necessary for the tripod she used to keep food out of the reach of prowling scavengers- she attached the narrower ends to the harness she had put on the horse, crossing them over above the withers. The heavier ends dragged on the ground, one on either side of the mare. With ropes, they fastened the grass mat across the more widely spread poles of the travois, near the ground, and attached extra ropes to tie down and hold the aurochs.  Looking at the size of the huge cow, Ayla began to wonder if perhaps it would be too much even for the strong steppe horse. The man an woman both strained to get the aurochs on the travois. The mat offer only minimal support, but by tying the animal directly to the poles, did not drag on the ground. After their efforts, Ayla was even ino concerned that the load would be too much for Whinney, sw s almost changed her mind. Jondalar had already removed the stoina  niher organs; perhaps they should skin it out right there rmore manageable pieces. She didn't feel the need to she could bring it to the Camp alone any more, but ady loaded on the travois, she decided to have Whinney (surprised when the horse began to pull the heavy load l terrain, Jondalar was even more so. The aurochs was avier than Whinney, and it was a strain, but with only logins, and most of the weight borne by the poles resting the load was manageable.

Then Ayla took the stomach and bladder to the small stream thtf supplied water for the Camp to wash them, and Jondalar went down to the river to find brush and slender trees that could be bent to make a round bowl-shaped frame for the small boat. They also searched fell deadfall and driftwood. They would need several fires to keep aniindil and insects away from their meat, as well as a fire inside overnight. |1 They worked until it was nearly dark, dividing the cow into land segments, then cutting the meat into small tongue-shaped pieces an)| hanging them to dry over makeshift racks made of brushwood, bat they still didn't finish. They brought the racks into the lodge overnight.  Their tent was still damp, but they folded it and brought it in, too. They would set it up again the next day when they brought the meat out, to let the wind and the sun finish the drying. ( In the morning, after they cut up the last of the meat, Jondalar beg- to construct the boat. Using both steam and hot rocks heated in d» fire, he bent the wood for the boat frame. Ayla was very interesteB and wanted to know where he learned the process.  "My brother, Thonolan. He was a spearmaker," Jondalar explainer holding down the end of a small straight tree that he had formed in-- a curve, while she lashed it to a circular section with sinew made a J tendon from the hind legs of the aurochs.  ^^ "But what does spear-making have to do with making a boat.  "Thonolan could make a spear shaft perfectly straight and true.  to learn how to take the bend out of wood, you first have to learn to bend wood, and he could do that just as well.

They were typical of the kind his people but he had learned how to make the flint-tipped Mamutoi spe well, and because he was a skilled flint knapper, they were fas) him to make than shaping and smoothing bone points.  In the afternoon Ayla started to make a special meat-keeping h When she lived in the valley, she had spent many long winter easing her loneliness by making baskets and mats, among other t and she had become very quick and adept at weaving. She could; make a basket in the dark, and her new carrying container foi was finished before she went to bed. It was made extremely we had thought carefully about the shape and size, materials and tig] of weave, but she wasn't quite satisfied with it.  She went out in the darkening twilight to change her absorbent and wash the piece she was wearing in the small stream. She pi near the fire to dry, but out of Jondalar's sight. Then, without c looking at him, she lay down in their sleeping furs beside him. We of the Clan were taught to avoid men as much as possible when 1 bled, and never to look at them directly. It made Clan men very vous to be around women during that time. It had surprised her Jondalar had no qualms about it, but she still felt uncomfortable, she took pains to be discreet in caring for herself.  Jondalar had always been considerate of her during her moon til sensing her disquiet, but once she was in bed, he leaned over to her.

As she fell asleep in the da lodge, Ayla felt pleased that she had thought of a way to reola.6' very necessary item that had been lost. ' During the next few days, while the meat dried, they were busy. They finished the bowl boat and coated it with the glue If made by boiling down the hooves, bone, and hide scraps. While drying, Ayla made baskets, for the meat they were leaving as a the people of the Camp, for cooking to replace those she had lo.  for gathering, some of which she planned to leave behind. She gat vegetable produce and medicinal herbs daily, drying some to tak< them.  Jondalar accompanied her one day to look for something to into paddles for the boat. Shortly after they started out, he was pi to find the skull of a giant deer that had died before the large pa antlers were shed, giving him two of equal size. Though it was i he stayed out with Ayla for the rest of the morning. He was Ie to identify certain foods himself, and in the process he was beg to understand how much Ayla really knew. Her knowledge of and her memory for their uses were incredible. When they retui the Camp, Jondalar trimmed the tines off the broad antlers a tached them to sturdy, rather short poles, making entirely servic paddles.  The next day he decided to use the wood-shaping apparatus h set up to bend the wood for the boat frame, to straighten shaf new spears. Shaping and smoothing them took most of the next' of days, even with the special tools he had with him, carried in of leather tied with thongs. But while he was working, every ^ passed by the side of the earthlodge where he had thrown it, j noticed the truncated spear shaft he had brought up from thi and felt a flush of annoyance. It was a shame that there wasnt to salvage that straight shaft, short of making a cropped and ' anced spear out of it. Any of the spears he was working so t make could break just as easily.  When he was satisfied that the spears would fly true, he u.  another tool, a narrow flint blade with a chisellike tip hafted antler-tine handle, to hollow out a deep notch in the thicker bu of the shafts. Then, from the prepared flint nodules he had witti Jondalar knapped new blades and attached them to the SP€ar.  with the thick glue he had made as a coating for the boat, a sinew.

But when Jondalar cast a newly completed Ipowerrul throw, and not only missed the target, but hit a loth bone that was used as an outdoor seat, he flinched. He bit as it bent and bounced back.

Full of excitement, Jondalar went intn lodge and got out his roll of leather and took it outside. He sat A on the ground and unrolled it, displaying the variety of carefully n flint tools, and picked out the chisel tool.

Ayla had stopped practicing with her spear-thrower and put it her spears in the holder that she had adapted to wear across her t over one shoulder, the way Jondalar did. She was walking back tow the lodge carrying some plants she had dug up when he came strk toward her with a big smile on his face.  "Look, Ayla!" he said, holding up the spear. The piece with broken point still attached was fitted into the top end of the long q shaft. "I fixed it. Now I'm going to see if it works!" She followed him back to the practice target and watched him the spear on the thrower, pull back and take aim, then hurl the q with great force.

She didn't want to think about Jondalar's people how long they still had to travel before they reached his home and' k.  didn't want to think about how they were going to cross that large fa» river with only a small round boat.  Jondalar lay awake as well, worried about their Journey and eager to be moving again, though he did think their stay had been very worth.  while. Their tent was dry, they had replenished their meat and re.  placed necessary equipment that had been lost or damaged, and he •wu excited about the development of the two-part spear. He was glad he had the bowl boat, but even with it, he was worried about crossing the river. It was a large waterway, wide and swift.

Gathering all their possessions and the boat, along with th animal traveling companions, they moved down to the river. But ( ciding the best way to get across was another matter. They stared the expanse of water rushing past, so wide that details of the bank the other side were difficult to see. With its fast current sliding o< and around itself in subdued ripples and eddies, making small chop waves, the sound of the deep river was almost more revealing than look.

This w-- becoming complicated. Trying to manage a boat could be difficult enough without trying to manage panicked horses, besides. He wa« feeling more and more worried about crossing this river.  "We put on their halters with lead ropes, and tie the ropes to the boat," Ayla said.  "I don't know... That may not be the best way. Maybe we should think about it some more," he said.  "What is there to think about?" she said, as she was wrapping coril around the three poles. Then she measured out a length and fastened!  it to the boat. "You were the one who wanted to get started," she added, while she put Whinney's halter on, attached a lead rope to it, then fastened it to the boat on the opposite side of the poles. Ho!  the slack, she stood beside the boat, then turned to Jondalar.  ready to go." He hesitated, then nodded decisively.

Then, with both of still holding the lead ropes, to maintain control of the animal^, pushed the boat into the water and scrambled to get in.  From the beginning, there was trouble. The swift current took of the small craft and swept it along, but the horses were not q' ready to enter the wide stream. They reared back as the boat trying to pull away, jerking the boat so violently that it nearly a!  over, making Wolf stumble to regain his footing and eye the situ nervously.

The large river, which the two riders along with the horses and rir wolf had crossed, emptied into the brackish inland body of water th» the Mamutoi called Beran Sea just north of the huge delta of the Gre» Mother River. As the travelers neared the many-mouthed culminatiM of the watercourse that had wound its way across the breadth of the continent for nearly two thousand miles, the downward slope of d» land leveled off. ?  The magnificent grasslands of this flat southern region surprisrf Ayla and Jondalar. A rich new growth, unusual so late in the seasws burgeoned across the open landscape. The violent thunderstorm with its downpour of flooding rains, exceptional in its timing and very wide"; spread, was responsible for the unseasonal greening. It brought 1 springlike resurgence to the steppes of not only grass, but colorful blooms: dwarf iris in purple and yellow, deep red multipetaled peonies, spotted pink lilies, and vetch in variable colors from yellow and orange to red and purple.  Loud whistling and squawking called Ayla's attention to the vodfr erous black-and-rose birds that were wheeling and dipping, separatin( and coming together in large flocks, creating a confusion of ceaselcs.  activity. The heavy concentration of the noisy, gregarious, rose.  colored starlings that had gathered nearby made the young wonut uneasy.

Suddenly the great horde of starlings came even more agitated.  "Jondalar," she called to the man who had ridden ahead of "Look at that strange cloud." The man looked, then stopped as Ayla pulled abreast again.  they watched, the cloud grew visibly larger, or perhaps closer. ; that's a rain cloud," Jondalar said.  it is, either, but what else could it be?"

During the season that was I dry, they were grasshoppers, shy, solitary creatures, who |(de others of their kind only long enough to mate, but a re- Ichange took place after the hard rainstorm. With the growth I' new grass, the females took advantage of the abundance of laying many more eggs, and many more larvae survived. As Chopper population grew, surprising changes took place.

Only when the rains stopped and the grasslands returned to their normal dry condition that could feed only small numben; would the locusts become well-camouflaged, innocuous grasshopper again.    The wolf found them shortly after they left the swarm behind. By the time the voracious insects were settled on the ground for the night, Ay la and Jondalar were camped far away. When they started out the; next morning, they headed north again and slightly east, toward a higlil hill to get a view above the flat landscape that might give them some idea of the distance to the Great Mother River. Just beyond the crest of the hill they saw the edge of the area that had been visited by Ac cloud of locusts, the swarming mass blown by the strong winds towarf the sea. They were overwhelmed by the devastation.  The beautiful, springlike countryside full of bright flowers and new grass was gone, stripped clean. As far as they could see the land w» denuded. Not a leaf, not a blade of grass, not a single hint of grectt dressed the bare soil. Every bit of vegetation had been devoured by the ravenous horde. The only signs of life were some starlings searching out the last few locusts that had fallen behind. The earth had been ravaged, laid open, and left indecently exposed. Yet she would recovtf from this indignity, brought on by creatures of her own making ; their natural cycles of life, and from hidden root and windblown sew; she would clothe herself in green once again.. | When the woman and man looked the other way, they were gree | with an entirely different vista, one that set their pulses racing ^ ward the east, a vast expanse of water glinted in the sun; it was u.

But there was something else, too, somethino 4 frightened her.  "I could never understand why Thonolan wanted to die... (,«, He turned away and, urging Racer to a faster pace, called back "Qn on. You said you wanted to hurry." Ayla signaled Whinney to a fast run, trying to be more careful as she trailed behind the man on the galloping stallion who was rad toward the river. But the ride was exhilarating and had the effect driving away the strange, sad mood that the place had evoked in be of them. The wolf, excited by the fast pace, ran along with them x when they finally reached the water's edge and stopped, Wolf lift his head and voiced a melodious wolf song of long drawn-out how Ayla and Jondalar looked at each other and smiled, both thinking was an appropriate way to announce that they had arrived at the rh that would be their companion for the greater part of the rest of th Journey.  "Is this it? Have we reached the Great Mother River?" Ayla sai her eyes sparkling.  "Yes. This is it," Jondalar said, then looked toward the west, u stream. He did not want to dampen Ayla's excitement at reaching t river, but he knew how far they had yet to go.  They would have to retrace his steps all the way back across t breadth of the continent to the plateau glacier that covered the highlai at the headwaters of the extensive river, and then beyond, almost the Great Water at the edge of the earth, far to the west. Along winding, eighteen-hundred-mile course, Donau--the river of Do' the Great Earth Mother of the Zeiandonii--swelled with the waters more than three hundred tributaries, the drainage of two glacier mountain chains, and acquired a burden of sediment.

Ayla looked back to make sure the drag- of the travois, with the bowl boat lashed between them, snagged; then she checked that the crossed ends in front dy as the poles floated up behind the mare.

They could load up the boat with their  <( gear so it wouldn't get wet, but rather than trying to lead the h across with a rope fastened to a boat, Whinney could swim acme her own pace, pulling an easy, floating load. When they tried it on the next river they had to cross, they even found it unnecessan unharness her.  There was a tendency for the current to drag at the boat and or which worried Ayla, especially after the way Whinney and Racer panicked when they were being pulled into a situation on the o river over which they had no control. She decided to redesign leather straps of the harness so that she could cut it loose in an ins if it seemed to endanger her mare, but the horse compensated for tug of the stream and accepted the burden with little trouble. Ayla taken the time to let the horse get familiar with the new idea Whinney was used to the travois and trusted the woman.  But the large open bowl was a container that invited filling. T started using it to carry wood, dry dung, and other materials for bi ing that they picked up along the way for the evening fire, and so times they left their pack baskets in the boat after crossing wa There had been several streams of various sizes that had found tl way to the inland sea, and Jondalar knew that many tributaries w( cut across their path as they continued their Journey, traveling be the Great Mother River.  As they waded into the clear water of the outside channel of delta, the stallion shied and whinnied nervously. Racer was unt about rivers since his frightening adventure, but Jondalar had b very patient about guiding the sensitive young animal across smaller waterways they had met, and the horse was overcoming fear. It pleased the man, since many more rivers would have to crossed before they reached his home.  The water was slow moving, but so transparent that they could fish swimming among the water plants. After making their ' through the tall reeds, they gained the long, narrow island. Wolf1 the first to reach the tongue of land.

Close to the end of the island they watched ^ clear water enter the main channel, and Ayla was amazed we currents, one transparent, one brown with silt, running ten other, with a distinct division of color. Eventually, though, the brown water dominated as the main channel rnu clear stream.  "Look at that, Jondalar," Ayla said, pointing to the sharp i of the parallel running waters.  "That's how you know when you're on the Great Mother B- That arm that will take you directly to the sea," he said. "But look there." ° Beyond a grove of trees, off to the side of the inlet, a thin stream1 smoke reached for the sky. Ayla smiled with anticipation, but londA had reservations as they headed for the smoke. If that was smoke ft- a fireplace, why hadn't they seen anyone? The people must have an them by now. Why hadn't they come to greet them? Jondalar st ened the rope he was using to lead Racer and patted his neck rea; ingly.  When they saw the outline of a conical tent, Ayla knew they I arrived at a Camp, and she wondered what people these were. The could even be Mamutoi, she thought, as she signaled Whinney i follow close. Then she noticed Wolf standing in his defensive postm and she whistled the signal she had taught him. He retreated to I side as they entered the small encampment. inney followed closely behind Ayla as the woman walked ip, to the fireplace that was still sending up a wavering e. There were five shelters arranged in a semicircle, and ug slightly into the ground, was in front of the central was burning briskly, the Camp had obviously been used no one announced any claim to the place by coming out i. Ayla looked around, glancing inside the dwellings that ut she saw no one. Puzzled, she studied the shelters and we closely to see if she could learn any more about who sre, and why they were gone.  part of each of the structures was similar to the conical the Mamutoi for their summer Camps, but there were fferences. Where the Mammoth Hunters often enlarged Mce by attaching semicircular side tents made of hides to elling unit, often using another pole to help support the s, the shelters of this Camp had, instead, additions made marsh grasses. Some were simply sloping roofs mounted )les, others were completely enclosed, rounded additions di and woven mats, attached to the main dwelling.  ie the entrance flap of the nearest one, Ayla saw a pile of I roots on a mat of woven reeds. Beside the mat were two ' was tightly woven and held slightly muddy water, the if-full of shiny white, freshly peeled roots. Ayla walked k a root out of the basket. It was still wet; it must have faere only a moment before.  ' it back, she noticed a strange object lying on the ground.  of cattail leaves woven to resemble a person, with two 5 out the sides and two legs, and a piece of soft leather "nd it like a tunic. Two short lines for eyes had been s face with charcoal, and another line shaped into a smile.  "cr grass had been fastened to the head as hair.  e Ayla had grown up with did not make images, except tern signs, such as the marks on her leg. She had been  ^ deeply scratched by a cave lion as a small girl, leaving her lefr.1 scarred with four straight lines. A similar mark was used by A to indicate a cave lion totem. That was why Creb had been so sn the Cave Lion was her totem, in spite of the fact that it was con<i'<i a male totem. The Spirit of the Cave Lion had chosen her and m her himself, and would therefore protect her.  Other Clan totems were indicated in similar ways, with sirnole often derived from the movements or gestures of their sign lanoi But the first truly representative image she had ever seen was the rr sketch of an animal Jondalar had drawn on a piece of leather used target, and she was puzzled at first by the object on the ground. T with a flash of recognition, she knew what it was. She had never li doll when she was growing up, but she recalled similar objects Mamutoi children played with and realized it was a child's playthi It was suddenly obvious to Ayla that a woman had been sitting t with her child only moments before. Now she was gone and she i have left in a great hurry, since she had abandoned her food and not even taken her child's toy with her. Why would she leave in!  a hurry?  Ayla turned and saw Jondalar, still holding Racer's lead rope, down on one knee amidst a scattering of flint chips and examini piece of the stone he had noticed. He looked up.  "Someone ruined a very good point with a badly made final so It should have been just a tap, but it landed off the mark, and tool ... as though the knapper was suddenly interrupted. And here'!  hammerstone! It was just dropped." The nicks on the hard oval s indicated its long use, and the experienced flint knapper found it ( cult to imagine anyone dropping and leaving a favored tool.  Ayla looked around and saw fish drying on a rack, with whole on the ground close by. One had been split open but left on ground. There was more evidence of interrupted tasks, but no sij!  the people.  "Jondalar, there were people here not very long ago, but they Ic a big hurry. Even the fire is still burning.

"I don't see anything( afraid of." Jondalar started to shake his head, then noticed Wolf sniffing the abandoned Camp, poking his nose into the entrances 01 and around the places where things had been left.

There had even been a couple of occasions when their livesi been saved by strangers. But if people were going to be afraid ofth because of their animal companions, what would happen if Ayla i he ever needed help?    They left the Camp and climbed back up the sandy dunes to level field at the top of the long, narrow island, stopping when ti reached the grass. They looked down at the thin column of smoke ft the Camp and the brown silty river below, its noticeable current he ing for the broad blue expanse of Beran Sea. With unspoken asa they both mounted and turned east to get a better--and a last--I at the great inland sea.  When they reached the eastern tip of the island, though still wit the banks of the river they were so close to the choppy waters of sea that they could watch its waves washing sandbars with briny fa l'|j !i11:1^ Ayla looked out across the water and thought she could almost see outline of a peninsula. The cave of Brun's clan, the place where had grown up, had been at its southern tip. It was there that she 1 given birth to her son, and there she had to leave him when she' forced out.  I wonder how big he is? she said to herself. Taller than all the b his age, I'm sure. Is he strong? Healthy? Is he happy? Does he renu her me? I wonder. If only I could just see him one more time, thought, then realized that if she was ever going to look for him,' would be her last chance. From here, Jondalar planned to turn w |j l^; She would never be this dose to her clan, or Durc, again. V couldn't they go east, instead? Just make a short side trip before tl went on? If they skirted the northern coast of the sea, they co probably reach the peninsula in a few days. Jondalar did say he w be willing to go with her if she wanted to try to find Durc.  "Ayla, look!

Turning her head so Jondal not see the tears that filled her eyes as she stared at the d ^ expanse of water, Ayla said a silent goodbye to her son fortk time. A fresh stab of grief filled her and she knew she would ca ache in her heart with her forever.    They turned their backs on the sea and started walking throuo waist-high steppe grass of the large island, giving the horses a res time to graze. The sun was high in the sky, bright and hot. Shin ing heat waves rose up from the dusty ground, bringing the' aroma of earth and growing things. On the treeless plain atop the narrow strip of land, they moved within the shade of their grass but the evaporation of the surrounding river channels made d humid and beads of sweat trickled down their dusty skin. They grateful for the occasional cool breath from the sea, a fitful breeze with the rich scent of the life within its deep waters.  Ayla stopped and unwound her leather sling from her hea( tucked it into her waistband, not wanting it to get too damp replaced it with a rolled piece of soft leather, similar to the one jot wore, bound across her forehead and tied in the back, to absor moisture that dripped from her forehead.  When she continued, she noticed a dull greenish grasshopper s up, then drop back down and hide in its camouflaged disguise.  she saw another. More of them chirked sporadically, bringing to the swarming locusts. But here they were just one of a varit insects, like the butterflies flicking their bright colors in a qu dance across the tops of the fescue, and the harmless drone fly resembled a stinging honeybee, hovering over a buttercup.  Though the raised field was much smaller, it had the familiar t» of the dry steppes, but when they came to the other end of the i and looked out, they were astonished by the vast, strange, wet' of the massive delta. To the north, on their right, was the mail beyond a fringe of river brush, a grassland of muted greenish-go to the south and west, spreading all the way to the horizon, and 1 distance seeming as solid and substantial as the land, was the outlet of the great river.

Then she whistled for Wolf.  more whistles before he came, and then it was from a  ^ different direction much farther downstream, far away from the the nesting birds.

He, too, would need to change, and fortunately his baskets happened to be in the bowl boat, which kept them dry It some time before he found his way back, riding toward Avia's from the west. Racer had gone far upstream before Jondalar caueb with him.  The man was still angry with Wolf, and it was apparent not onl Ayla but to the animal.

"It seems as though he's trying to say he's sorry, but that's bar believe. How could he? He's an animal. Ayla, could Wolf know he misbehaved and be sorry for it?" Jondalar asked.  Ayla wasn't surprised. She had seen such actions when she teaching herself to hunt and observing carnivorous animals, which had chosen to be her prey. Wolfs actions toward the man were sin to the way a young wolf often behaved toward the male leader i pack.  "I don't know what he knows, or what he thinks," Ayla said. "I only judge from his actions. But isn't that how it is with people?  can never know what someone really knows or thinks. You haw judge by actions, don't you?" Jondalar nodded, still not sure what to believe. Ayla didn't dfi that Wolf was sorry, but she didn't think it would make much du ence.

The entire vast delta was an extravagant, ostentatious demor of natural abundance; a wealth of life flaunted without shame.  spoiled, undamaged, ruled by her own natural law and subject i her own will—and the great void whence she sprang—t' Mother Earth took pleasure in creating and sustaining life prolific diversity.

As she sti sparks with flint from her firestone, she wished she didn't havi bother with a fire. The food she had set by the night before and a water would have been enough for their morning meal, and thini about the Pleasures she and Jondalar had shared, she wished she cc forget about Iza's magic medicine. If she didn't drink her special maybe she could find out if they had started a baby. But Jondalar so upset at the idea of her getting pregnant on this Journey, that had to drink the tea.  The young woman didn't know how the medicine worked. She knew that if she drank a couple of bitter swallows of a strong decoc of golden thread every morning until her moon time, and a small b of the liquid from boiled antelope sage root each day that she bleeding, she didn't get pregnant.  It would not be so hard to take care of a baby while they v traveling, but she didn't want to be alone when she gave birth.  didn't know if she would have lived through Durc's birth if Iza hai been there.

The trees assortment of deciduous and coniferous varieties, that, like the ni of the steppes, were distributed in a mosaic pattern of disri woods, broken by meadows and lakes, and in some lowlands bogs or marshes. Certain trees grew in pure stands or in assocm with other trees or vegetation depending on minor variations in mate, elevation, availability of water, or soil, which could be loam sandy or sand mixed with clay, or several other combinations.  Evergreen trees preferred north-facing slopes and sandier soils where the moisture was sufficient, grew to great heights.

In the distance ahead, the travelers could see the silvery leavi white poplars mixed in with a stand of oaks, and when they rea the place, they found the oak woods alive with breeding tree spar nesting in every conceivable cranny. Ayla even found nests of sparrows with eggs and young birds in them, built inside the nes magpies and buzzards, that were themselves inhabited by eggs young. There were also many robins in the woods, but their y were already fledged.

Bur yond the valley, where the mountains angled back, they began hex due west. They were as far south as they would go on their Toun and it was the hottest season of the year.  During the highest days of summer, with an incandescent scourging the shadeless plains, even when ice as thick as mount covered a quarter of the earth, the heat could be oppressive in southern stretches of the continent. A strong, hot, unceasing wind i wore on their nerves made it worse. The man and woman, riding i by side, or walking the scorching steppes to let the horses rest, fell a routine that made traveling, if not easy, at least possible.  They awakened with the first glimmer of dawn glistening off highest peaks to the north and, after a light breakfast of a hot tea cold food, were on their way before the day was fully light. As the rose higher, it struck the open steppes with such intensity that st mering heat waves issued from the earth. A patina of dehydra sweat gleamed the deeply tanned skin of the humans and soaked fur of Wolf and the horses. The wolfs tongue lolled out of his dm as he panted with the heat. He had no urge to run off on his ow explore or hunt but kept pace with Whinney and Racer, who plod along, their heads hanging low. Their passengers drooped lisdes allowing the horses to proceed at their own speed, talking little du the suffocating heat of midday.  When they could not take it any longer, they looked for a.  beach, preferably near a clear backwater or slow-moving channe the Great Mother. Even Wolf did not resist the slower curre though he still hesitated a bit when a river ran fast.

Jondalar recalled that Thonolan had developed m" hunting in the mountains with them. The Ramudoi e other hand, knew the river and hunted its creatures, giant sturgeon. Jondalar had been more interested in the "ing the ways of the river. Though he had climbed the mountains with the chamois hunters on occasion, he didn't carp for heights.  Sighting a small herd of red deer, Jondalar decided that it }vn n a good opportunity to procure a supply of meat to see them th the next few days until they reached the Sharamudoi, and nprt, bring some with them to share. Ayla was eager when he suggest?.) She enjoyed hunting and they hadn't done much of it recently for bringing down a few partridges and other small game, which usually did with her sling. The Great Mother River had been so eivi it hadn't been necessary to hunt much.  They found a place to set up their camp near the small river their pack baskets and the travois, and started off in the direct of the herd with their spear-throwers and spears. Wolf was exdl they were changing their routine, and the spears and throwers siew their intentions to him. Whinney and Racer seemed friskier, too only because they were no longer carrying pack baskets or drags poles.  This group of red deer was a bachelor herd, and the antlers of ancient elk were thick with velvet.

Sitting astride the horse gave the man an overall view, and other advantage he would not have had on foot. Several of the antte animals had stopped feeding, aware of the presence of the newcofflf but horses were not threatening. They were fellow grazers that w usually tolerated or ignored, if they were not signaling fear. Even« the presence of human and wolf, the deer were not yet concen enough to run.  Looking over the herd to decide which one to try for, Jondalar tempted by a magnificent stag with a commanding rack who seem be looking directly at him, as though assessing the man in Perhaps if he'd been with a band of hunters needing food for a Cave, and wanting to show off their prowess, he might have cons going after the majestic animal.

"Ayla of the Mamutoi, this is Dolando, leader of the Shami land-living half of the Sharamudoi," Jondalar said in Mamutoi.  then changed to Dolando's language: "Dolando of the Sharamudoi, ( is Ayla, Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth of the Mamutoi."

"In the name of the Great Mother, Mudo, I welcome you, the Mamutoi." "In the name ofMut, the Great Earth Mother, I thank you, of the Sharamudoi," Ayla said, taking both his hands.

Jondalar translated for Ayla, and she nodded her willingness left the horses grazing in the field, but she signaled Wolf to sta her. She could tell that the carnivore still bothered people- horses were strange but not considered dangerous. A wolr hunter, capable of inflicting harm.

She dipped her little finger into it to check the te ature, then put it down and, gracefully lowering herself to the g in a cross-legged position, sat quietly for a moment.  Her thoughts were drawn back to her life with the Clan, and i ularly to the training she had received from the skilled and knowli able medicine woman who had raised her. Iza had taken care of i ordinary illnesses and minor injuries with practical dispatch, but' she had to treat a serious problem—an especially bad hunting ace or a life-threatening illness—she asked Creb, in his capacity as i ur, to call upon higher powers for their assistance. Iza was a med woman, but in the Clan, Creb was the magician, the holy man, had access to the world of the spirits.  Among the Mamutoi and, from the way Jondalar talked, appar among his people as well, the functions of medicine woman and i ur were not necessarily separated. Those who healed often interc with the spirit world, though not all of Those Who Served the M were equally well versed in every capacity that was open to them.  Mamut of the Lion Camp was much more like Creb. His interests in things of the spirit and the mind. Though he did have knowledgl certain remedies and procedures, his healing abilities were relafl^ undeveloped, and it often fell to Talut's mate, Nezzie, to deal winl minor injuries and illnesses of the Camp. At the Summer Met.  however, Ayla had met many skilled healers among the mainuW had exchanged knowledge with them.  But Ayla's training had been of the practical kind. Like Iza, s a medicine woman, a healer. She felt herself to be unknowledgea the ways of the spirit world, and she wished at that moments someone like Creb to call on. She wanted, and felt she need assistance of any powers greater than herself that would be help.

Of the three, Jondalar was the only one she was doing, and he found himself watching the other two as much as Ay la. Though his knowledge of the guage was rudimentary--it was far more complex than he ir.  he did understand that she was asking for help from the spirit Jondalar simply did not see some of the finer nuances of a merit communicating that had been developed upon an entirely dift,, basis than any verbal language. It was impossible to fully tra anyway. At best, any translation to words seemed simplistic kn did think her graceful motions were beautiful. He recalled that ri was a time when he might have been embarrassed over her act.  and he smiled to himself now at his foolishness, but he was cur about how Roshario and Dolando would interpret Ayla's behavior Dolando was perplexed and a little disturbed, since her actions i completely unfamiliar. His concern was for Roshario, and anvd strange, even if it might be for a good purpose, felt slightly threaten When Ayla was through, Dolando looked at Jondalar with a quest ing expression, but the younger man only smiled.  The injury had debilitated Roshario, leaving her weak and feva not enough to make her delirious, but drained and disoriented, more open to suggestion. She had found herself focusing on the known woman and was strangely moved. She didn't have the least what Ayla's movements meant, but she did appreciate their flov gracefulness. It was as though the woman were dancing with hands, indeed with more than her hands. She evoked a subtle ba with her motions. Her arms and shoulders, even her body, see integral parts of her dancing hands, responding to some inte rhythm that had a definite purpose. Though she didn't understai any more than she understood how Ayla had known she needed help, Roshario was certain it was important, and that it had sometl to do with her calling. She was Shamud; that was sufficient. She knowledge beyond the ken of ordinary people, and anything seemed mysterious only added to her credibility.  Ayla picked up the cup and got up on her knees beside the bed.  tested the liquid again with her smallest finger, then smiled at shario.

' "First, I will want you to support her arm at the elbow whil to break it where it is joining wrong," she said.

"I understand," he said; at least he thought he did.  "Make sure you are in a comfortable, steady position, straighten I arm and support her elbow up about this far, and let me know you are ready," Ayla directed.  He held her arm and braced himself. "All right, I'm ready," t With both hands, one on either side of the break that bent unnatural angle, Ayla took hold of Roshario's upper arm, gripping J experimentally in several places, feeling for the protruding end ill-knit bone under the skin and muscle.

The go tissue had not cemented the fracture too firmly yet, perhaps ] in its unnatural position the bone had not been joined in a way thatj encouraged healing. It was a good clean break. She breathed a sigh OT] relief. That part was done. She wiped the sweat off her brow with the back of her hand.  Jondalar was watching her with amazement. Though only party healed, it took very strong hands to break a bone like that. He bad always loved her sheer physical strength ever since he was first aware of it in her valley. He realized that she needed strength living alonetf she did, and thought that having to do everything for herself probably encouraged more muscle development, but he hadn t k" how strong she really was... ^ Ayla's strength came not only from being forced to exert herse Jl to survive when she lived in the valley; it had been developing 1.-h<lf WE.' the time she was first adopted by Iza.

She felt it fall into place, carefully eased the the bed, and finally let go.  When Jondalar looked up, she was shaking, her eyes were IJ and she was breathing hard.

She took a few more deep breaths, then looked at him and smil»i broad, happy smile of victory. "Yes, I think I did," she said. "is I need to put on the splints." She carefully felt along the stra.  normal-looking arm again. "If it heals right, if I haven't done damage to her arm while it was without feeling, I think she will be i to use it, but she is going to be very bruised and it will swell up." Ayla dipped the strips of chamois skin in the hot water, placed spikenard and yarrow on it, wrapped it loosely around the arm t told Jondalar to ask Dolando if he had the splints ready.  When Jondalar stepped out of the dwelling, a crowd of faces era him. Not only Dolando, but all the rest of the Cave, both Shanu and Ramudoi, had been keeping a vigil in the gathering place aro the large hearth. "Ayla needs the splints, Dolando," he said.  "Did it work?" the Shamudoi leader asked, handing him the p» of smoothed wood.  Jondalar thought he should wait for Ayla to say, but he smi Dolando closed his eyes, took a long deep breath, and shuddered i relief.  Ayla placed the splints in position and wrapped more chamois st around them. The arm would swell, and the poultice would havet replaced. The splints were to hold the arm in place so Rosha movements would not disturb the fresh break. Later, when the s< ing went down and she wanted to move about, birchbark, dampt with hot water, would mold to her arm and dry into a rigid cast.  She checked the woman's breathing again, and the pulses mhen and wrist, listened to her chest, lifted her eyelids, then went to entrance of the dwelling.  "Dolando, you can come in now," she said to the man who was outside the door.  "Is she all right?" "Come and see for yourself." The man went in and knelt down beside the sleeping woman, st3 at her face. He watched her through several breaths, assuring 'aal that she was breathing, then finally looked at her arm.

"But don't spoil your appetite," Tholie added. "We are having a feast tonight, in honor of Jondalar's return." She did not add th was also in honor of Ayla for helping Roshario.

Tholie picked the girl up, giving Jondalar a chance to see her be "If you look very closely, you can see where the bum was, bui hardly noticeable. I'm grateful, the Mother was kind to her."

Tholie couldn't resist the compliment to offspring, and she smiled warmly at the tall, beautiful woman, was not, however, what she claimed to be. Tholie had resolved to her with reserve and caution until she learned more.  Ayla picked up a skin and began drying herself. "This is so soft, nice to dry with," she said, then stretched it around herself and to an end in at the waist. She picked up another to dry her hair, wrapped it around her head.

Then went to check on Roshario. She smiled at Darvalo, who was sic listlessly outside the dwelling, and she nodded to Dolando when entered and approached the woman lying on the bed. She exami her briefly, just to make sure she was all right.  "Should she still be sleeping?" Dolando asked, with a won frown.  "She's fine. She will sleep a while longer yet." Ayla looked at medicine bag, then decided that it would be a good time to gather a fresh ingredients for a reviving tea to help bring Roshario out of datura-induced sleep when she did begin to awaken. "I saw a lin tree on my way here. I want some flowers for a tea for her and, if I find them, a few other herbs. If Roshario wakes up before I get bl you can give her a little water.

"Maybe; should take Darvo with you." Ayla was sure she would have no trouble finding her way, but decided to take the lad with her anyway. In all the concern for: shario, he had been somewhat neglected, and he was worried at the woman, too.  "Thank you, I will," she said.  Darvalo had overheard the conversation and was standing and re to go with her, looking pleased to be useful.  "I think I know where that linden tree is," he said. "There are alW a lot of bees around it this time of year." j "That's the best time to gather the flowers," Ayla said, "when smell like honey.

He would wait to see how well her arm heala Ayla noticed the Ramudoi leader's response, but she thought it understandable, given the circumstances.

He decided he liked pretty, nice-smelling things, too, like Ayla.  liked the way she always called him Darvalo, and not Darvo, the \softline everyone else did. Not that he minded so much when Dolandc Jondalar called him that, but it was nice to hear her use his grown name. Her voice sounded nice, too, even if she did say some wop little funny. All it did was make you pay attention to her when talked, and after a while think about what a nice voice she had.  There was a time when he wished more than anything that ]ond would mate his mother and stay with the Sharamudoi. His mod mate had died when he was young, and there had never been a i who lived with them until the tall Zeiandonii man came. Jondalar treated him like a son of his hearth—he had even begun to teach to work the flint—and Darvalo had felt hurt when the man left.  He had hoped Jondalar would come back, but he never really pected it. When his mother left with that Mamutoi man, Gulec.  was sure there would be no reason for the Zeiandonii man to stay 1 did come back. But now that he had come, and with another won his mother didn't need to be there. Everyone liked Jondalar, i especially since Roshario's accident, everybody talked about how ffl they needed a healer. He was sure Ayla was a good one. Why coul they both stay? he thought.  "She woke up once," Dolando said the instant Ayla entered dwelling. "At least I think she did. She might have pst been thrast in her sleep. She has quieted down and is sleeping again now.

I wished she knew more of the language so she could tell her own stoi It was not going to be easy to explain, or rather to make the explanaO believable. The more time that passed, the more unreal it all seernt even to him, but when Ayla told it, it seemed easier to accept.  "No. We didn't know Lion Camp then. Ayla was living alone, u valley several days' journey away from Lion Camp," he said.  "Alone?" Roshario asked.  "Well, not entirely alone. She shared her small cave with a couple animals, for company." "Do you mean she had another wolf like this one?" the woffl asked, reaching over to pat the animal.  "No. She didn't have Wolf then.

I decided to stay in the valley until the spring." The people had become so involved with her story, they were sn ing out, nodding in agreement, saying she was right, it was the thing to do. Ay la explained how she trapped a horse in a pit t discovered it was a nursing mare, and later saw a pack of hyenas m after the little filly. "I couldn't help myself," she said. "She was w baby, and so helpless. I chased the hyenas away and brought he live in my cave with me. I'm glad I did. She shared my loneliness she made it more bearable. She became a friend." The women, at least, could understand being drawn to a hek baby, even if it was a baby horse. The way Ayla explained it ma( seem perfectly reasonable, even if no one had ever heard of adop an animal before. But it wasn't only the women who were captiva Jondalar was watching the people. Women and men were equally thralled, and he realized that Ayla had become a good storyteller. E he was caught up, and he knew the story.

"The same way she controls Wolf and Whinney," Jondalar sa "She told him to stop, and he did." Heads were shaking in disbelief. "How do you know that's what; did?

It was a question that she had refusec consider. It had come to her mind more than once, but she alw pushed it aside, not even wanting to acknowledge it.

Instead, she deeply buried pain and saw a distancing; a menacing hard » his eyes as though he could not see clearly, but only ? red haze of rage.  "Flatheads!" he exploded. "You lived with those filthy, run animals! I'd like to kill every one of them. And you lived with How could any decent woman live with them?" His fists were clenched as he started to come for her. Both T and Markeno jumped up to hold him back. Wolf was standing of Roshario, teeth bared, a deep low growl in his throat started to cry, and Tholie picked her up and held her prot< close. Under most circumstances, she would never fear for her ter around Dolando, but he was not rational about flatheads an moment he seemed to be in the grip of an uncontrollable madness "Jondalar! How dare you bring a woman like that here!" DolanAS said, trying to shake off the restraining hold of the tall blond man J "Dolando! What are you saying?" Roshario said, trying to get late "She helped me!

Carlono oat up to help Markeno and Jondalar and to try to calm his coleader. s1, Ayla was stunned, too. Dolando's virulent reaction was so conit pletely unexpected that she was at a loss. She saw Roshario attempting to get up, trying to push aside the wolf, who was standing defensive^ in front of her, as confused as everyone else by the commotion, but determined to protect the woman he saw as his charge. She should not get up, Ayla thought, hurrying toward the woman.  "Get away from my woman. I don't want her tainted with your filth," Dolando shouted, struggling to free himself from the men trying to hold him back.  Ayla stopped. Though she wanted to help Roshario, she didn't want to cause more trouble with Dolando. What is wrong with him? she wondered. Then she noticed that Wolf looked ready to attack, and she signaled him to come to her. That was the last thing she needed, for the wolf to cause anyone harm. Wolf was obviously struggling with himself. He wanted either to stand his ground or jump into the fray, but he did not want to back away from it; yet everything was confusing.  Ayla's second signal was accompanied by her whistle, and tnai decided him. He ran to her, then stood defensively in front of her.  Though he spoke Sharamudoi, Ayla was aware that Dolando had been shouting about flatheads and directing angry words at ner' " the meaning had not been entirely clear.

"We may have all jumped to some conclusions," Roshario said. "Yon said you lived with... some people on the peninsula?" There was suddenly absolute silence.  "Yes," Ayla said. Then she looked at Dolando and took a deep breath. "The Clan. The ones you call flatheads, that is what they caB themselves." "How? They don't talk," a young woman called out. Jondalar saw it was the woman sitting next to Chalono, another young man he knew.  She was familiar, but her name eluded him for the moment.  Ayla anticipated her unspoken comment. "They are not animals.  They are people, and they do talk, but not with many words, though they use some. Their language is of signs and gestures." "Is that what you were doing?" Roshario asked. "Before you put me to sleep? I thought you were dancing with your hands." Ayla smiled. "I was talking to the spirit world, asking my totem spirit to help you." "Spirit world? Talking with hands? What nonsense!" Dolando spat "Dolando," Roshario said, reaching for his hand.  "It's true, Dolando," Jondalar said. "I even learned some of it. All" Lion Camp did. Ayla taught us so we could communicate with Rydag.  Everyone was surprised to find out he could talk that way, even dot couldn't say words right. It made them realize he was not an animal.  "You mean the boy Nezzie took in?" Tholie said.  "Boy? Are you talking about that abomination of mixed spirits tt>» we heard some crazy Mamutoi woman took in?" ; Ayla's chin went up.

I Ayla had just come into the dwelling after spending a little time currying and combing Whinney in the dying light of the sunset, h always relaxed her and made her feel better to be near and tend to die mare when she was upset. Jondalar had joined her there for a short time but had sensed that she wanted to be alone for a while, so after some pats and scratches and comforting words to the stallion, he had left them.  "Perhaps Darvo could stay with you," Jondalar suggested now. "He would probably sleep better. It bothers him to see her suffer." "Of course," Markeno said. "I'll go get him. I wish I could convince Dolando to stay with us for a while, too, but I know he won't, especially after tonight. No one ever told him the full story of Doraldo's death." "Maybe it's best that it all finally came out. Maybe he can finally put it aside now," Tholie said. "Dolando has been nursing a real hatred toward flatheads for a long time. It seemed fairly harmless, no one really cares that much for them anyway-- I'm sorry, Ayla, but it is true." Ayla nodded. "I know," she said. ^, "And we seldom have much contact. In most ways, he's a gooo leader," Tholie continued, "except for anything to do with flatbead^ and it's easy to work other people up about them. But such a strono hatred can't help but leave its mark. I think it's always worse on person who does the hating." ^ "I think it's time to get some rest," Markeno said. "You niu51 exhausted, Ayla." , ^g Jondalar, Markeno, and Ayla, with Wolf at her heels, walked lu".  to the next dwelling together. Markeno scratched at the lap and waited.

Dolando watched with curiosity as a small pile of the dry, light shavings of wood and, hovering pounds it, hit one stone against the other. To his surprise, a large  bright spark leaped from the stones and landed on the tinder up a thin column of smoke. She bent close and blew, and the burst into flame.  "How did you do that?" he asked, surprised and a little fea-d Anything so amazing, and unknown, always engendered a little f Was there no end to this woman's shamud magic? he wondered.  "It comes from the firestone," Ayla said, as she added a few stick kindling to keep the fire going, and then larger pieces of wood.  "Ayla discovered them when she was living in her valley," Jondal said. "They were all over the rocky shore there, and I collected son extras. I'll show you how they work tomorrow, and give you one you will know what they look like. There may be some around ha As you can see, they make starting a fire much faster." "Where did you say the fat was?" Ayla asked.  "In the box by the entrance. I'll get it. The wicks are there, toe Dolando said. He put a dollop of soft white tallow—fat that had be rendered in boiling water and skimmed after it cooled—into the sto bowl, stuck a twisted strand of dried lichen in it, next to the edge, th picked up a burning stick and lit it. It sputtered a bit; then a pool ofi started to form in the bottom of the bowl and was absorbed by t lichen, causing a steadier flame and more even light within the wood structure.  Ayla put cooking stones in the fire, then checked the level in t wooden water box. She started outside with it, but Dolando took and went out to get more water instead. While he was gone, Ayla ai Jondalar put the bedding on a sleeping platform. Then Ayla select some dried herbs from her medicine packets to make a relaxing tea 1 all of them. She put other ingredients in some of her own bowls have it ready for Roshario when she woke up. Not long after Dolan brought in the water, she gave cups of tea to each of them.  They sat in silence, sipping the warm liquid, which was a relief Dolando. He was afraid they would want him to make conversatic and he was in no mood for it. It wasn't a matter of mood to Ayla. a simply didn't know what to say. She had come for Roshario's sal though she would have preferred not to be there at all. The prosp of spending the night within the dwelling of a man who had raged anger against her was not pleasant, and she was grateful Jondalar h chosen to stay with her.

She looked across and saw several chil-  dren of various ages in the pool made by the waterfall alorur several women, all taking a morning bath. She walked toward with Wolf close to her side. Shamio squealed when she saw him "C'mon, Wuffie. You should take a bath, too," the girl said W«jtl whined, looking up at Ay la. | "Would anyone mind if Wolf got in the pool, Tholie? Shamio seenr "I to want him to come in and play." "I was just getting out," the young woman said, "but she can stay in and play with him, if the others don't mind." When no one made an objection, Ayla gave him a signal. "Go ahead Wolf," she said. The wolf bounded into the water, making a big splash- straight to Shamio.  A woman who was coming out of the water alongside Tholie smiled.  then said, "I wish my children would mind as well as that wolf does.  How do you make him do what you want?" j "It takes time. You have to go over it a lot, make him repeat what you want many times, and it can be difficult to make him understand at first, but once he learns something, he doesn't forget. He's really very smart," Ayla said. "I've been teaching him every day while we | were traveling." "Sounds like teaching a child," Tholie said, "but why a wolf? I never knew you could teach them to do anything, but why do you do it?" "I know he can be frightening to people who don't know him, and I didn't want him to scare anyone," Ayla said. Watching Tholie come out of the pool and dry herself, Ayla was suddenly aware she was pregnant. Not too far along yet, and her plumpness concealed it when she was dressed, but she was definitely pregnant. "I think I'd like to wash, too, but first I have to pass water." "If you follow that path up the back, you'll find a trench. It's quite a ways up, over the far wall so it runs off the other side when it rains, but it's closer than going around," Tholie said.  Ayla started to call Wolf, then hesitated. As usual, he had lifted his leg in the bushes--she had taught him to go outside of dwellings, but not to use special places. She watched the children playing with him and knew he would rather stay, but she wasn't sure if she should leave him. She was sure everything would be fine, but she didn't know no the mothers would feel.  "I think you can leave him for a while, Ayla," Tholie said. "I've seen him around the children, and you were right. They'd all be disappointed if you called him away so soon." ] Ayla smiled. "Thank you. I'll be right back." She started up the path that traversed in a diagonal across the st?'j e wall and then switchbacked toward the other. When far wall she climbed over it on steps made put of short These were held in place with stakes pounded into the of them, so they would not roll, and filled in behind dirt.  ad a level area in front of it, lined with a low fence of >es to sit across, had been dug out of the sloping ground e of the wall.

The woods ; so familiar that Ayla had forgotten where she was for a mo- ttttming the hillsides, she had felt like a girl again, using the tfiooking for Iza's medicinal plants to explore.

I She scanned the ground under the trees carefully. With so much that was familiar, it shouldn't have come as a surprise, but when she saw ^ the green leaves of one particular kind of plant, she gasped and felt a ; cold chill go through her.    Lyia dropped to the moist ground and sat staring at the reathing the rich forest air, while memories came flooding ai in the Clan the secret of the root was little known.

In the back of her throat she i tasted the dark cool loam and growing fungus of ancient primeval forests. She sensed herself moving with great speed to the stranee worlds she had traveled with Mamut, and she felt the terror of the black void. s Then faintly, from far away, she heard Jondalar's voice, full of I agonized fear and love, calling to her, pulling her back and Mamut as well, by the sheer strength of his love and his need. In an instant she was back, feeling chilled to the bone in the warmth of late summer sunshine.  "Jondalar brought us back!" she said aloud. At the time she hadn't been aware of it. He was the one she had opened her eyes to, but then he was gone and Ranee was there instead bringing a hot drink to warm her. Mamut had told her that someone had helped them to return. She hadn't realized that it was Jondalar, but suddenly she knew, almost as though she was meant to know.  The old man had said he would never use the root again and warned her against it, but he also said that if she ever did, to make sure someone was there who could call her back. He'd told her the root was more than deadly. It could steal her spirit; she could be lost in the black void forever, and would never be able to return to the Great Earth Mother. It hadn't mattered then, anyway. She'd had no roots left. She had used the last of them with Mamut. But now, in front of her, there was the plant.  Just because it was there didn't mean she had to take it, she thought.  If she left it, she would never have to worry that she might use it again and lose her spirit. She had been told the drink was forbidden to her, anyway. It was for mog-urs who dealt with the spirit world, notvaed' icine women who were only supposed to make it for them, but she n already drunk it, twice. And besides, Broud had cursed her; as far the Clan was concerned, she was dead. Who was there to forbid ne now?. j Ayla didn't even ask herself why she was doing it when she pi011 up the broken branch and used it as a digging stick to carefully extra j J E.he plants without damaging the roots. She was one of the Ie on earth who knew their properties and how to prepare fccould not leave them. It wasn't that she had any partici-alar fusing them, which in itself was not unusual.

It was secret knowledge meant onl medicine women.  A thought suddenly occurred to Ayla. If it could prevent Her fr.  blessing a woman, could Iza's magic medicine be stronger than Mother? How could that be? But if She did create all the plants in first place. She must have made it on purpose! She must have mea^ for it to be used to help women when it would be dangerous or diffieni.3 for them to become pregnant. But then why didn't more women knn» about it? Maybe they did. Since it grew so close, maybe these Shara.  mudoi women were familiar with it. She could ask, but would th» tell her? And if they didn't know, how could she ask without tellinn them? But if the Mother meant it for women, wouldn't it be right to tell them? Ayla's mind raced with questions, but she had no answers.  "Why did you need to get plants for bites and stings now?" Jondalar said, his concern still showing in his eyes. | "I didn't meant to worry you," Ayla said, then smiled, "it's just that this area feels so much like home, I wanted to explore it." Suddenly he had to smile, too. "And you found some blackberries for breakfast, didn't you? Now I know what took you so long. I never' met anyone who loved blackberries more than you do." He had noticed her discomfiture, but he was delighted when he thought he had discov ered why she seemed so reluctant to talk about her little side trip.  "Well, yes, I did have a few. Maybe we can go back later and pick some for everyone. They are so ripe and good now. There are some other things I want to look for, too." "I have a feeling we're going to have all the blackberries we could want, with you around, Ayla," Jondalar said, kissing her purple- stained mouth.  He was so relieved that she was safe, and so pleased with himself to think that he had found her out and discovered her weakness for sweet berries, that she just smiled and let him think what he wanted. She did like blackberries, but her real weakness was him, and she suddenly re" such an overwhelming warmth of love for him that she wished they were alone. She wanted to hold him, and touch him, and Pleasure huDi and feel him Pleasuring her the way he did so well.

"It's never easy to lose a son," Ayla said, "or a daughter." i I Roshario thought she saw a look of pain flash across the you woman's face as she got up and went to the fire to start preparanoi When she came back, she brought her medicines in her interesti wooden bowls. The woman had never seen any quite like them. M< of their tools, utensils, and containers were decorated with carvings paintings, or both, particularly Shamud's. Ayla's bowls were fine made, smooth and well-shaped, but starkly plain. There were no d< orations of any kind, except for the grain of the wood itself.  "Are you feeling much pain now?" Ayla asked as she helped B shario lie down.  "Some, but not nearly as much as before," the woman said, as t young healer started to remove the wrappings.  "I think the swelling is down," Ayla said, studying the arm. "Tha a good sign. I'll put the splints and a sling back on it for now, in cs you want to get up for a while. I'll put another poultice on tonigl When there is no more swelling, I'll wrap it in birchbark, which y should keep on until the bone is healed; at least a moon and halfw into another," Ayla explained, as she deftly took away the damp cha ois skin and looked at a spreading bruise caused by her manipulatic the day before.  "Birchbark?" Roshario said.  "When it is soaked in hot water, it softens and is easy to shape a fit. It gets hard and stiff as it dries, and will hold your arm rigid so t bone will heal straight, even when you are up and moving around.  "You mean I'll be able to get up and do something, instead of)' lying around?" Roshario said with a delighted grin.  "You will only have the use of one arm, but there's no reason y can't stand on both legs. It was the pain that kept you here." Roshario nodded. "That's true."

I "It's not as easy to control as your boats, but it's used mostly ft»5 crossing rivers, and the paddles work well enough to push it across Of1 course with the horses, we just attached it to the pole drag and let them pull it," Jondalar said. 1 They both glanced across the field where Ayla was currying Whin.5 ney while Racer stood by. Jondalar had brushed the stallion's coat^ earlier and noticed that bare spots, where hair had fallen out on the hot1 plains, were filling in. Ayla had treated the eyes of both horses. Nwr that they were in a cooler, higher elevation away from the bothersome gnats, there was obvious improvement.  "It's the horses that are most surprising," Markeno said. "I never imagined they would willingly stay near people, but those two seem to enjoy it. Although I think I was more surprised by the wolf at first." "You are more used to Wolf now. Ayla kept him close to her because she thought he would be more frightening to people than the horses." They saw Tholie walking toward Ayla, with Shamio and Wolf running around her. "Shamio just loves him," Markeno said. "Look at her.  I ought to be afraid, that animal could tear her apart, but he's not threatening at all. He's playing with her." "The horses can be playful, too, but you can't imagine what it's like to ride on the back of that stallion. You can try it, if you want, though there isn't much room here for him to really run." "That's all right, Jondalar. I think I'll stick to riding in boats," Mar^ keno said. As a man appeared at the edge of the cliff, he added, "And here comes Carlono. I think it's time for Ayla to ride in one." They all converged near the horses, then walked together toward the cliff and stood at the place where the small stream spilled over the edge into the Great Mother River below. , "Do you really think she ought to climb down? It's a long drop a" it can be scary," Jondalar said. "It's even a little unsettling for n^- haven't done it in quite a while." „ "You said you wanted to give her a ride in a real boat, Jondala i Markeno said.

The flat woven Mwch was reinforced and stiffened with wooden planks, was l|a long oval with straight sides around the edge like a low ?yas easily big enough to hold a person lying down, or a ^e sturgeon with its head and tail over the front and back.  |tsturgeon, one of two varieties that lived only in the river and Uributaries, reached thirty feet in length and weighed over "^and pounds, and had to be cut into pieces to be hoisted up.  Bply basket was slung between two ropes that were threaded pu held in place by four rings made of fiber, two attached to J?.de. Each rope went down through one ring, and up through  the ring that was diagonally on the opposite side, crossing unde The four ends of the ropes were plaited together and formed large heavy loop above, and the rope that had been thrown ov.'1" edge was threaded through that loop. ' "Just climb in, Ayla. We'll hold it steady and lower you dn Markeno said, putting on a pair of close-fitting, leather mittens ri wrapping the long end once around the second stake in preparation^ lowering the basket. ^ When she hesitated, Tholie said, "If you'd rather just climb do»«>l I'll show you how. I never did like to ride the basket." Ayla looked at the steep climb again. Neither way looked very inviH.  ing. "I'll try the basket this time," she said.  Where the path down was located, the wall below the cliff was stet» but sloped enough to make it climbable, barely; near the middle where the stakes were, the top of the cliff overhung the wall. Ayla climbed!  into the basket, sat down on the bottom, and held on to the edge wiA a white-knuckled grip.  "Are you ready?" Carlono asked. Ayla turned her head without letting go and nodded. "Lower her down, Markeno." The young man loosened his grip as Carlono guided the supply basket over the edge. While Markeno let the rope slide through htt leather-covered hands, controlling the descent with the help of the twist around the stake, the loop at the top of the basket skidded along the heavy rope and Ayla, suspended in empty space over the dock, was slowly lowered.  Their device for transporting supplies and people between the deep ledge above and the dock below was simple but effective. It depended upon muscle power, but the basket itself, though sturdy, was relatively lightweight, making it possible for even one person alone to move fairly large loads. With additional people, quite heavy ones could be moved.  When she first dropped over the top of the cliff, Ayla shut her eyes and clung to the basket, hearing her heart pound in her ears. But as she felt herself dropping slowly, she peeked her eyes open, then looked around in open-mouthed wonder. It was a view from a perspective she had never seen before and would probably never see again.  Hanging out over the great moving river beside the steep wall oftut gorge, Ayla felt that she was floating in air. The rock wall across tK river was slightly more than a mile away, but it felt very close, thoug" in places along the Gate the walls were much closer. It was a fair?  straight stretch of river and, as she looked east and then west along - length, she could feel its power. When she had nearly reached W dock, she looked up and watched a white cloud appear over the edfr. H and she noticed two figures--one quite small--and the ine down at her. She waved. Then she landed with a slight Ie she was still looking up.  tie saw Jondalar's smiling face, she said, "That was exciting!" etty spectacular, isn't it?" he said, helping her out.  i of people was waiting for her, but she was more interested x than the people. She felt a swaying movement under her she stepped out of the basket onto wooden planks, and she ey were floating on water. It was a sizable dock, large enough veral dwellings of a construction similar to the ones under one ledge, plus open areas. There was a fire nearby, built on mdstone and surrounded by rocks.  of the interesting boats she had seen before, used by the tvnstream--narrow and coming together in a sharp edge at md back--were tied to the floating construction. They were sizes, no two exactly the same, ranging from barely big hold one person to long ones with several seats.  turned to look around, she saw two very large boats that a". The prows extended up to become the heads of strange I the boats were painted with various geometric markings, ether gave the impression of feathers. Extra eyes were :ar the water line.

They ed along by the group, which was eager to show the visitor unusual craft and their boating expertise.

Most of the people walked up the balancing easily even though the boat and the dock some- Wd at cross-purposes, but Ayla was grateful for the hand itended to her.  between Markeno and Jondalar under the canopy that ex- «n one side to the other, on a bench that could easily have toted more. Other people sat on benches in front and back, ftem taking up very long-handled paddles. Before she knew I" cast off the ropes that held them to the dock and were in tof the river.  ^s sister Carolio, singing out from the front of the boat in a ^ strong high voice, began a rhythmic chant that rose above the r melody of the Great Mother River. Ayla watched with fascinate the rowers pulled against the powerful current, intrigued by th they rowed in unison to the beat of the song, and she was surori how swiftly and smoothly they were propelled upstream.  At the bend in the river, the sides of the rocky gorge closed Between the soaring walls that reared out of the depths of the voliii nous river, the sound of the water grew louder and more intense A could feel the air becoming cooler and damper, and her nostrils fla at the wet clear smell of the river and the living and dying of life v/u it, so different from the crisp dry aromas of the plains.  Where the gorge widened out again, trees grew on both sides do to the edge of the water. "This is beginning to look familiar," Jondi said. "Isn't that the boat-making place ahead? Are we going to s there?" "Not this time. We'll keep going and turn around at Half-Fish." "Half-Fish?" Ayla said. "What is that?" A man sitting in front of her turned around and grinned. A recalled that he was Carolio's mate. "You should ask him," he & glancing at the man beside her. Ayla watched a red glow fill Jondal face as he blushed with embarrassment. "It's where he became ha Ramudoi man. Hasn't he told you about it?" Several people laughe "Why don't you tell it, Barono?" Jondalar said. "I'm sure it won'l the first time." "Jondalar's right about that," Markeno said. "It's one of Baroi favorite stories. Carolio says she's tired of hearing it, but every knows that he can't stop telling a good story, no matter how in times he's told it." "Well, you must admit, it was funny, Jondalar," Barono said. " you should tell it." Jondalar smiled in spite of himself. "To everyone else, maybe." ^ was looking at him with a puzzled smile. "I was just learning to hal small boats," he began. "I had a harpoon--a spear for fish--with and started upriver, and then I noticed the sturgeon were on the mt I thought it might be my chance to get the first one, not thinking at how I would ever land a big fish like that alone, or what would hap in such a small boat." "That fish gave him the ride of his life!" Barono said, unabl< resist.  "I wasn't even sure I'd be able to spear one; I wasn't used to a s with a cord attached," Jondalar continued. "I should have w011 about what would happen if I did." "I don't understand," Ayla said. ntine on land and spear something, like a deer, even if 1 it and the spear falls out, you can trail it," Carlono can't follow a fish in water.

"As I said, I think Jondalar would make a good River man," Tholfc continued when everyone had settled down, "but Ayla is most familiar with the land, and I'd like to encourage Jondalar to stay with the land hunters, if he is willing and they will accept him. If Jondalar and Ayla would stay and become Sharamudoi, we would make an offer to cross- mate with them, but since Markeno and I are Ramudoi, they would have to be Shamudoi." There was a great outburst of excitement among the people, with encouraging remarks and even congratulations directed at the two couples.  "That's a wonderful plan, Tholie," Carolio said.  "It was Roshario who gave me the idea," Tholie said.  "But what does Dolando think about accepting Jondalar, and Ayla, a woman who was raised by the ones who live on the peninsula?" Carolio asked, looking directly at the Shamudoi leader.  There was a sudden silence. Everyone knew the implications other question. After his violent reaction to Ayla, would Dolando be willing to accept her? Ayla had hoped his angry raving would be forgotten and wondered why Carolio had brought it up, but she had to do it. It was her responsibility.  Carlono and his mate had originally been cross-coupled with D°"; lando and Roshario, and together they had founded this particular group of Sharamudoi when they and a few others moved away iron1 their rather crowded birthplace. Positions of leadership were usually conferred by informal consensus, and they were the natural choice.ln practice, a leader's mate usually took on the responsibilities of a co- leader, but Carlono's woman had died when Markeno was q111 young. The Ramudoi leader never formally mated again and w- twin sister, Carolio, who had stepped in to care for the boy, began ?i/« duties of a leader's mate as well.

I would be happy if the Sh^i mudoi accepted Ayla and Jondalar." ; Ayla felt the relief wash over her. Now she truly understood whf this man had been chosen by his people to lead them. In their day-today lives, they had come to know him well, and they knew the basie quality of the man.  "Well, Jondalar?" Roshario said. "What do you say? Don't you think it's time to give up this long Journey of yours? It's time to settle, time to set up your own hearth, time to give the Mother a chance to bless Ayla with a baby or two." "I cannot find words to tell you how grateful I am," Jondalar began, "that you would welcome us, Roshario. I feel that the Sharamudoi are my people, my kin. It would be very easy to make a home here among you, and you tempt me with your offer. But I must return to the Zeiandonii"--he hesitated for a moment--"if only for Thonolan's sake." He paused, and Ayla turned to look at him. She had known he would refuse, but that was not what she expected him to say. She noticed a subtle, nearly indiscernible nod, as though he'd thought of something else. Then he smiled at her.  "When he died, Ayla gave Thonolan's spirit what comfort she could for his Journey through the next world, but his spirit was not laid W rest, and I am afraid, I have a feeling, that he wanders lost and alone, trying to find his way back to the Mother." His remark surprised Ayla, and she watched him closely as he con" tinued.  "I cannot leave it like that.

"I told Roshario her arm would have to be held rigid in that birch.  bark for a moon and halfway into the next," Ayla said.  "That's too long. We can't stay that long!" "How long can we stay?" Ayla asked.  "Not very long at all." "But who will take the bark off? Who will know when the time is right?" "We have sent a runner for a shamud," Dolando offered. "Wouldn't another healer know?" "I suppose so," Ayla said, "but I would like to talk to this shamud.  jondalar, can't we stay at least until he comes?" "If it's not too long, but maybe you should consider telling Dolando or Tholie what to do, pst in case." jondalar was brushing Racer, and it seemed that the stallion's coat was growing in and thickening fast. He thought he had detected a decided nip in the air that morning, and the stallion seemed particularly frisky.  "I think you are as eager as I am to be moving, aren't you, Racer?  he said. The horse flicked his ears in jondalar's direction at the sound of his name, and Whinney tossed her head and nickered. "You want to go, too, don't you, Whinney? This really isn't a place for horses. You need more open country to run in. I think I should remind Ayla of that." He gave Racer a final slap on the rump, then headed back toward the overhang. Roshario seems much better, he thought when he no- ticed the woman sitting alone near the large fireplace, sewing with one hand, using one of Ayla's thread-pullers. "Do you know where Ay- is?" he asked her.  "She and Tholie went off with Wolf and Shamio.

Roshario thought it Mbiy please him.    opened his eyes to the rumpled bedding of the empty place He pushed the covers aside, sat up on the edge of the bed pawned and stretched. Looking around, he realized he must late. Everyone else was up and gone. There had been d the fire the night before of chamois hunting. Someone  had seen them moving down from the high crags, which meant season for hunting the sure-footed mountain-goatlike antelopes w soon begin.  Ay la had been excited about going on a chamois hunt, but vA they went to bed and talked to each other in quiet tones, as they ofi did, Jondalar had reminded her that they had to leave soon. If chamois were coming down, it meant it was getting cold in the hi meadows, which signaled a turn of the seasons. They had a lone ^"1 to travel yet, and they needed to be on their way. 4 They hadn't argued, exactly, but Ayla had indicated she didn't wai to go. She talked about Roshario's arm, and he knew she wanted hunt chamois. In fact, he felt sure that she wanted to stay with tl- Sharamudoi, and he wondered if she was trying to delay their depart ture in the hope that he would change his mind. She and Tholie werei already fast friends, and everyone seemed to like her. It pleased hi® that she was so well liked, but it was going to make the leaving more difficult, and the longer they stayed, the harder it would get.  He lay awake far into the night, thinking. He wondered if they should stay, for her sake, but then, they could have stayed with the Mamutoi just as well. He finally came to the conclusion that they would have to leave as soon as possible, within the next day or two.  He knew Ayla was not going to be happy about it, and he wasn't sure how to tell her.  He got up, put on his trousers, and started toward the entrance.  Pushing aside the drape, he stepped outside and felt a sharp cool wind on his bare chest. He was going to need warmer clothes, he thought, hurrying to the place where the men passed their morning water.  Instead of the cloud of colorful butterflies that usually fluttered nearby —he had wondered why they should be so attracted to the strong- smelling place—he suddenly noticed a colorful leaf fluttering down, and then he saw that most of those left on the trees were starting to turn.  Why hadn't he noticed that before? The days had passed so quickly and the weather had been so pleasant that he hadn't paid attention to the changing season. He suddenly recalled that they were facing sou® in a southern region of the land. It could be much later into the seaso than he thought, and much colder to the north, where they we heading. As he hurried back to the dwelling, he was more deternu than ever that they had to leave very soon.  "You're awake," Ayla said, entering with Darvalo while Jonda was dressing.

"I like it," the young man said, holding out his arms and lookino down, trying to see how it looked. Maybe he'd wear it the next time they went to visit the Sharamudoi downriver. She might like it that girl he'd noticed.  "I'm glad I had a chance to show you how to wear it..." Jondalar said, "before we left." "When are you leaving?" Darvalo asked, looking startled.  "Tomorrow, or the day after at the latest," Jondalar said, looking straight at Ayla. "As soon as we can get ready." "The rains may have started on that side of the mountains," Dolando said, "and you remember what the Sister is like when she's flooding." "I hope it won't be as bad as that," Jondalar said. "We'd need one of your big boats to cross." "If you want to go by boat, we would take you to the Sister," Carlono said.  "We need to get more bog myrtle, anyway," Carolio added, "and that's where we go for it." "I would be happy to go up the river in your boat, but I don't think the horses can ride in one," Jondalar said.  "Didn't you say they can swim across rivers? Maybe they could swim behind the boat," Carlono suggested. "And the wolf could ride.  "Yes, horses can swim across a river, but it's a long way to the Sister, several days as I recall," Jondalar said, "and I don't think they could , swim upriver for such a long distance." "There is a way over the mountains," Dolando said.

She might fit in better than I. They I will be strangers, and she will learn about them very quickly, the way I she always does..." "And you will have expectations," Roshario said, starting toward the ] wooden shelters again. Before they entered, the woman stopped again, i "You will always be welcome here, Jondalar. Both of you." ; "Thank you, but it's such a long way to travel. You have no idea I how long, Roshario." "You're right. I don't. But you do, and you are used to traveling. If you should ever decide that you want to come back, it won't seem so long." "For someone who never dreamt of making a long Journey, I have already traveled more than I want," Jondalar said. "Once I get back, I think my Journeying days will be over. You were right when you said it was time to settle, but it might make getting used to home easier knowing that I have a choice." When they pushed the entrance flap aside, they found only Markeno inside. "Where's Ayla?" Jondalar asked.  "She and Tholie went to get the plants she was drying. Didn't you see them, Roshario?" "We came from the field. I thought she was here," Jondalar said.  "She was. Ayla's been telling Tholie about some of her medicines.  After she looked at your arm yesterday, and started explaining what to do for you, they've been talking about nothing but plants, and w"3 they are good for. That woman knows a lot, Jondalar."

It's too beautiful to wear," Ayla said. Then she put the garments i and hugged the woman. For the first time since she arrived, Rogi, .noticed Ayla's strange accent, particularly in the way she said cen^ words, but she didn't find it unpleasant. ^ "I hope it fits. Why don't you try it on so we can see?" Rosh J said.  "Do you really think I should?" Ayla said, almost afraid to touch n "You have to know if it will fit, so you can wear it when you an Jondalar are mated, don't you?" Ayla smiled at Jondalar, excited and happy about the outfit, but sh refrained from mentioning that she already had a mating tunic, give to her by Talut's mate, Nezzie of the Lion Camp. She couldn't exacd wear both of them, but she would find a very special occasion for tt beautiful new outfit.  "I have something for you, too, Ayla. Not nearly as beautiful, bi useful," Tholie said, giving her a handful of soft leather straps that sh had tucked away in a pouch that dangled from her waist.  Ayla held them up and avoided looking at Jondalar. She knew a actly what they were. "How did you know I needed fresh straps ft my moon time, Tholie?" "A woman can always use some new ones, especially when she traveling. I have some nice absorbent padding for you, too. Roshari and I talked about it. She showed me the outfit she had made for yoi and I wanted to give you something beautiful, too, but you can't tall much with you when you travel. So I started to think about what yo might need," Tholie said, explaining her very practical gift.  "It's perfect. You couldn't have given me something I needed, ( wanted, more. You are so thoughtful, Tholie," Ayla said, then turne her head and blinked her eyes. "I'm going to miss you." "Come now, you're not leaving yet. Not until tomorrow morninj There's plenty of time for tears then," Roshario said, though her ow eyes threatened to overflow.  That evening, Ayla emptied both her pack baskets and had ever) thing she wanted to take with her spread out, trying to decide how l pack it all, including the quantities of food they had been given. Joi dalar would take some of it, but he didn't have much room, eithe They had discussed the bowl boat several times, trying to decide it" usefulness in crossing rivers was worth the effort it would take to nio^ it across the wooded mountain slopes.

"I wondered that myself," Jondalar said. "She said a baby can ea» whatever its mother eats, but it has to be softer and easier to chew She cooked up broth, soaked a piece of soft leather in it, and let him suck it, and she cut meat up into tiny pieces for him. He eats anythino we eat now, but he still likes to hunt for himself sometimes. He even flushes game for us, and he helped us get that elk we brought with us when we came." "How do you get him to do what you want him to?" Markeno asked.  "Ayla spends a lot of time at it. She shows him and goes over it again and again until he gets it right. It's surprising how much he can learn and he's so eager to please her," Jondalar said.  "Anyone can see that. Do you think it's just her? After all, she is shamud," Carlono said. "Could just anybody make animals do what he wants?" "I ride on Racer's back," Jondalar said, "and I'm not shamud." "I wouldn't be too sure of that," Markeno said, then laughed. "Remember, I've seen you around women. I think you could make any one of them do whatever you wanted." Jondalar flushed. He hadn't really thought about that for a while.  As Ayla walked toward them, she wondered about his red face, but then Dolando joined them, coming from around the wall.  "I'll go with you part of the way to show you the trails and the best way over the mountains," he said.  "Thank you. That will be a help," Jondalar said.  "I'll go along, too," Markeno said.  "I would like to come," Darvalo said. Ayla looked in his direction and saw that he was wearing the shirt Jondalar had given him.  "So would I," Rakario said.  Darvalo looked at her with an annoyed frown, expecting to see her staring at Jondalar, but she was looking at him instead, with an adoring smile. Ayla watched his expression change from annoyance, to puzzlement, to understanding, and then to a surprised blush.  Almost everyone had congregated in the middle of the field to say farewell to their visitors, and several others voiced a wish to walk along with them for part of the way.  eoine," Roshario said, looking atjondalar and then Ay la, |you were staying.

A& and Jondalar stood in a clearing that commanded a broad ; mountain, feeling a sense of loss and loneliness as they llando, Markeno, Carlono, and Darvalo walking back down he rest of the large crowd that had started out with them id back by twos and threes along the way.

Her son was one of them; she had to ac I that fact. ^^l Jondalar felt desolate as well, watching the last four turniiw h-xA.  toward their home. They were all friends he had lived with for sev i I years and had known well. Though their relationship was not thronok ^ his mother and her ties, he felt they were as much kin as his o"n blood. In his commitment to return to his original roots, they we family he would never see again, and that saddened him.  When the last of the Sharamudoi that had seen them off moved our of sight. Wolf sat on his haunches, lifted his head, and gave voice to a few yips that led to a full, throaty howl, shattering the tranquillity of the sunny morning. The four men appeared again on the trail below and waved one last time, acknowledging the wolfs farewell. Suddenly there was an answering howl from one of his own kind. Markeno looked to see which direction the second howl came from before they S started back down the trail. Then Ay la and Jondalar turned and faced i the mountain with its glistening peaks of blue-green glacial ice.  Though not as high as the range to the west, the mountains in which they were traveling had been formed at the same time, in the most recent of the mountain-building epochs—recent only in relation to the ''• ponderously slow movements of the thick stony crust floating on the molten core of the ancient earth. Uplifted and folded into a series of parallel ridges during the orogeny that had brought the whole conti nent into sharp relief, the rugged terrain of this farthest east expansion of the extensive mountain system was clothed with verdant life.  A skirt of deciduous trees formed a narrow band between the plains below, still warmed by the vestiges of summer, and the cooler heights.  Primarily oak and beech with hornbeam and maple also prominent, the leaves were already changing into a colorful tapestry of reds and yellows accented by the deep evergreen of spruce at the higher edge.  A cloak of conifers, which included not only spruce, but yew, fir, pine, and the deciduous-needled larch, starting low, climbed to the rounded shoulders of lower prominences and covered the steep sides of higher peaks with, subtle variations of green that shaded to the yellowing larch. Above the timberline was a collar of summer-green alpine pas ture that turned white with snow early in the season. Capping it was the hard helmet of blue-tinged glacial ice.  The heat that had brushed the southern plains below with th® ephemeral touch of the short hot summer was already fading, g^10?  way to the grasping clutch of cold. Though a warming trend had bee moderating its worst effects—an interstadial period lasting several thousands of years—the glacial ice was regrouping for one last assa j K before the retreat would be turned to a rout thousands of ' But even during the milder lull before the final advance, not only coated low peaks and mantled the flanks of high r it held the continent in its grip.

'T I done my share. Sometimes you get drawn into it, for one reason <» i another, but I can't say I liked it, not if it's serious. I don't ramA wrestling or other competitions, though." ' "Men of the Clan don't fight with each other. It's not allowed but they do have competitions," Ayla said. "Women do, too, but they are a different kind." "How are theirs different?" Ayla paused to think about it. "The men compete in what they do- the women in what they make," she said, then smiled, "including babies, though that is a very subtle competition, and nearly everyone thinks she is the winner." Farther up the mountain, Jondalar noticed a family of mouflon, and he pointed out the wild sheep with huge horns that curled around close to their heads. "Those are the real fighters," Jondalar said. "When they run at each other and bang their heads together, it sounds almost like a clap of thunder." "When stags and rams run at each other with their antlers or horns, do you think they are really fighting? Or are they competing?" Ayla asked.  "I don't know. They can hurt each other, but they don't very often.  Usually one just gives up when another one shows he is stronger, and sometimes they just strut around and bellow, and don't fight at all.  Maybe it is more competition than actual fight." He smiled at her.  "You do ask interesting questions, woman." A fresh cool breeze turned chilly as the sun dipped below the edge of vision. Earlier'in the day, light sittings of snow had drifted down and melted in the open sunny spaces, but some had accumulated in the shady nooks, forecasting the possibility of a cold night, and heavier snows to come.  Wolf disappeared shortly after their hide shelter was set up. "w he hadn't returned by dark, Ayla felt anxious about him. "Do y° think I should whistle to call him back?" she asked as they were getting ready to settle down for the night. , "It's not the first time he's gone off to hunt by himself, Ayla.

Why wouldn't he let me go with them?" Ayla said with tears in her eyes and a sob in her voice.  "Who's gone?" he said, taking her in his arms.  "Durc is gone, and Creb wouldn't let me go with him. He blocked the way. Why wouldn't he let me go with him?" she said, cryine in his arms.  "It was a dream, Ayla. It was only a dream. Maybe it means something, but it was just a dream." ; "You're right. I know you're right, but it felt so real," Ayla said.  "Have you been thinking about your son, Ayla?" "I guess I have," she said. "I've been thinking I'll never see him again." "Maybe that's why you dreamed about him. Zeiandoni always said when you have a dream like that, you should try to remember everything about it, and that someday you might understand it," Jondalar said, trying to see her face in the dark. "Go back to sleep now." They both lay awake for some time, but finally they dozed off again.  When they woke up the next morning, the sky was overcast and Jondalar was anxious to be on their way, but Wolf had still not returned.  Ayla whistled for him periodically as they struck their tent and repacked their gear, but he still did not appear.  "Ayla, we need to go. He'll catch up with us, just like he always does," Jondalar said.  "I'm not going until I know where he is," she said. "You can go or wait here. I'm going to look for him." "How can you look for him? That animal could be anywhere." "Maybe he went back down. He did like Shamio," Ayla said.  "Maybe we should go back to look for him." "We're not going back! Not after we've come this far." "I will if I have to. I'm not going until I find Wolf," she said.  Jondalar shook his head as Ayla started backtracking. It was obvious she was adamant. They could have been well on their way by now it wasn't for that animal. As far as he was concerned, the SharafflU could have him!  Ayla kept whistling for him as she went along, and suddenly, I05 j ie back into the woods, he appeared on the other side of nd raced toward her.

The slope was easy for Wolf. He had run up to the top and back" down again while they were carefully leading the horses up. Whea they reached the top. Ay la whistled for him and waited, Jondalar watched her and it occurred to him that she seemed much more pro tective toward the animal. He wondered why, thought about asking her, changed his mind afraid she would get angry, then decided to bring it up anyway.  "Ayla, am I wrong, or are you more concerned about Wolf than you were? You used to let him come and go. I wish you'd tell me wha^s troubling you. You were the one who said we shouldn't keep things from each other." She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, her forehead wrinkled in a frown. Then she looked up at him. "You're right. It's not that I was keeping it from you. I've been trying to keep it from myself.  Remember those deer down there, that were rubbing the velvet off their antlers?" "Yes." Jondalar nodded.  "I'm not sure, but it might be the season of Pleasures for wolves, too. I don't even want to think about it, for fear that would make it happen, but Tholie brought it up when I was talking about Baby leaving to find his own mate. She asked me if I thought Wolf would leave someday, like Baby did. I don't want Wolf to leave, Jondalar.  He's almost like a child to me, like a son." "What makes you think he will?" "Before Baby left, he would go off for longer and longer times, f^ a day, then several days, and sometimes, when he came back, I co see he had been fighting. I knew he was looking for a mate.

Ayla looked around in awe, her eyes glistening with wonder, moved by the grandeur and beauty of the sight. In the chill, sharp air, pufi.  of steam escaping her mouth made every excited breath perceptible.  "Oh, Jondalar, we are higher than everything. I have never been so high. I feel like we're on the very top of the world!" she said. "And iri so... so beautiful, so exciting." As the man watched her expressions of wonder, her sparkling eyes, her beautiful smile, his own enthusiasm for the dramatic panorama was fired by her sheer excitement, and he was moved with immediate desire for her.  "Yes, so beautiful, so exciting," he said. Something in his voice sent a shiver through her and made her turn away from the extraordinary view to look at him.  His eyes were such an impossibly rich shade of blue, it seemed fort moment that he had stolen two small pieces of the deep, luminous blue sky, and filled them with his love and wanting. She was caught by them, captured by his ineffable charm, whose source was as unknow able to her as the magic of his love, but which she could not—and did not want to—deny. Just his desire for her had always been his "signal.  For Ayla, it was not an act of will but a physical reaction, a need as strong and driving as his own.  Without being aware that she moved, Ayla was in his arms, feeling his strong embrace and his warm and eager mouth on hers. There w^ certainly no lack of Pleasures in her life; they shared that Gift of "lc Mother regularly, with great enjoyment, but this moment was excep tional. Perhaps it was the excitement of the setting, but she wit heightened awareness of every sensation.

She felt the wai wetness moisten her folds, and the instant shiver from the cold fill her with a fierce heat. With a moan, she arched up to him.

With stronger pressi and the familiar provocation of his mouth and hands, stimulatii encouraging, inciting her senses to respond, she lost all sense of wh( she was. She felt only his mouth sucking, his tongue licking and prc ding her place of Pleasure, his knowing fingers reaching inside, a then only the rising tide within her reaching a crest, and washing o her, while she reached for his manhood and guided it to her well.

The horses had waited patient the wolf had watched with interest, but had learned to contain more active curiosity. Finally Jondalar lifted himself, rested on arms, and looked down at the woman he loved.  "Ayla, what if we started a baby?" he asked.  "Don't worry, Jondalar. I don't think we did." She was grateful- had found more of her contraceptive plants, and she was teropte" tell him, as she had told Tholie.

Streams filled and overflo and rivulets spilling over ledges became gushing torrents. The fnn», grew slick and dangerous in places.  They were both grateful for their Mamutoi rain parkas mad dehaired deer hides, Jondalar's from megaceros, the giant deer of steppes, and Ayla's from the northern reindeer. They were worno their fur parkas, when the weather was cold, or over their reel tunics when it was warmer. The exterior surfaces were colored w red and yellow ochres. The mineral pigments had been mixed v fats, and the color was worked into the hides with a special burnish tool made of rib bone that brought the garments to a hard, shiny lus that was also quite water repellent. Even wet, it provided some pro.  tion, but the burnished, fat-soaked finish was unable to entirely re the soaking deluge.  When they stopped for the night and put up the tent, everyth was damp, even their sleeping furs, and no fire was possible. Tl brought wood into their tent, mostly the dead lower branches of a fers, hoping it would dry overnight. In the morning the rains I poured and their clothes were still damp, but using a firestone and tinder she had with her, Ayla managed to get a small fire going, enoi to boil a little water to make a warming tea. They ate only the squ compressed cakes of traveling food Roshario had given them, wh were a variation of the commonly made, filling, nutritious, corny food that could sustain a person indefinitely even if that was all he; It consisted of some variety of meat that was dried then ground up i mixed with fat, usually some dried fruit or berries, and occasions partially cooked grains or roots.  The horses were standing outside the tent impassively, their he drooping and water dripping from long winter fur, and the bowl I had fallen over and was half-full of water. They were ready to leav and the dragging poles behind. The travois that had been so useful hauling loads across the open grasslands, and with the addition of round boat effective for transporting their gear across rivers, had b an encumbrance in the rugged, forested mountains. It had hamP® and slowed their travel, and it could even be dangerous going d0 difficult slopes in the pouring rain. If Jondalar hadn't known that most of the rest of their Journey the passage would still be a0 plains, he would have left it long before.  They unfastened the boat from the poles and poured out the w3 turning the boat upside down and eventually lifting it over th. ierneath, holding the round boat above their heads, they h other and grinned.

The damp fur parkas of the man and woman were "< if not completely comfortable, especially with the wet "ir inside the hoods. After a while water trickled down  their necks, but there was little they could do about it. As the dr T| skies continued to leak, Ayla decided that rain was her least fav^1 kind of weather. lc I It rained during the next few days almost constantly, all the w down the side of the mountain. When they reached the tall conif ^ there was some protection under the canopy, but they left most of Hut trees behind them where a broad terrace leveled out, though the riv was still far below them. Ayla began to realize that the river she had seen from above must be much farther and even bigger than sh» thought. Though it had slacked up occasionally, the rain did not stoo and without the protection of the trees, scant though it was, they we» wet and miserable, but they gained one advantage. They were able to ride the horses, at least part of the time.  They rode west down a series of loess terraces that fell off from the mountains, the higher ones dissected by countless small streams filled and overflowing with drainage from the highland, the result of die deluge that poured from the sky. They slogged through mud and crossed several swirling waterways rushing down from the heights.  Then they dropped down to another terrace and unexpectedly came upon a small settlement. ; The rough wooden shelters, little more than lean-tos, obviously put!  together quickly, looked ramshackle, but they offered some protection ; from the constantly falling water and were a welcome sight to the travelers. Ayla and Jondalar hurried toward them. They dismounted, conscious of the fear that the tame animals might cause people to fed, ; and called out in Sharamudoi, hoping it would be a familiar language, j But there was no answer, and when they looked closer, it was obvious that no one was about. ; "I'm sure the Mother realizes we need shelter. Doni will not object if we go in," Jondalar said, stepping inside one of the shacks and looking around. It was completely empty, except for a leather thong hanging from a peg, and its dirt floor was sloppy mud where a stream ; had run through it before it was diverted. They went out and headed for the largest one.  As they approached it, Ayla became aware that something importaw was missing. "Jondalar, where is the donii? There is no figure of Mother guarding the entrance." He looked around and nodded. "This must be a temporary sutasa camp. They did not leave a donii because they did not call upon to protect it.

The at were wrapped around the stem averaged about two feet »ut an inch or more in width, tapering to a point. Ayla had ;hing Jondalar the basics of weaving, and after watching her i method she was using to make square sections of flat mats, m to make one like them. Ayla looked down at her work, smiling (elf. She couldn't help it. She still felt a sense of surprise that |T was able to do woman's work, and she was delighted by his taess. With both of them working, they soon had as many S made as there were leaks.  structures were made of a rather thin thatch of reeds fastened isic frame of long tree trunks, not much more than saplings, together. Though not made of planks, they were similar to the ed dwellings made by the Sharamudoi, except the ridgepole did pc and they were asymmetrical. The side with the entrance g, facing the river, was nearly vertical; the opposite side leaned it at a sharp angle. The ends were closed, but they could be d up somewhat like awnings.  (^went out and attached the mats, tying them down with lengths ough, stringy cattail leaves. There were two leaks near the peak ere difficult to reach even with Jondalar's six-foot-six-inch and they did not think the structure would bear the weight of if them. They decided to go back inside and try to think of a patch them, remembering at the last moment to fill a waterbag and some bowls with water for drinking and cooking. When Tondal reached up and blocked one of the leaks with his hand, it finally curred to them to fasten the patch from the inside.  After they covered the entrance with the mammoth hide tarp Avi looked around the darkened interior, lit only by the fire that was stan ing to warm the place, feeling snug. The rain was outside and they were inside a place that was dry and warm, though it was staitinp to get steamy as the wet things began to dry, and there was no smokehole in the summer dwelling. The smoke from fires had usually escaped through the less-than-airtight walls and ceiling, or the ends, which were often left open in warmer weather. But the dried grass and reeds had expanded with the moisture, making it harder for smoke to escape and it began to accumulate along the ridgepole at the ceiling.  Though horses were accustomed to being out in the elements and usually preferred it, Whinney and Racer had been raised around people and were used to sharing human habitations, even darkened smoky ones. They stayed at the end that Ayla had decided would be their place, and even they seemed glad to be out of the waterlogged world.  Ayla put cooking rocks in the fire; then she and Jondalar rubbed down the horses and Wolf, to help them dry.  They opened all the packages and bundles to see if anything had been damaged by the excess moisture, found dry clothes and changed into them, and sat by the fire drinking hot tea, while a soup, made from the compressed traveling food, was cooking. When the smoke began to fill the upper levels of the dwelling, they broke holes through the light thatch of both ends near the top, which cleared it out and added a little more light.  It felt good to relax. They hadn't realized how tired they were, and before it was even fully dark, the woman and man crawled into their still slightly damp sleeping furs. But as tired as he was, Jondalar could not go to sleep. He remembered the last time he had faced the swift and treacherous river called the Sister, and in the dark he felt a chill 01 dread at the thought of having to cross her with the woman he loved. Lyia and Jondalar stayed at the abandoned summer camp he next day, and the next. By the morning of the third day, inally slacked off.

No, that wouldn't work if we wei» riding at the same time... but... maybe, I could make somethino the horses could carry on their rumps, behind us..." She lookedat Jondalar. "Yes, I think I can make carriers that will work." They gathered reed and cattail leaves, osier willow withes, lone thin spruce roots, and whatever else Ayla saw that she thought could be used as material for baskets or for cordage to construct woven contain ers. Trying various approaches and fitting it on Whinney, Ayla and Jondalar worked on the project all day. By late afternoon they had made a sort of pack-saddle basket that was sufficient to hold Ayla's belongings and traveling gear, that could he carried by the mare while she was riding, and that would stay reasonably dry when the horse was swimming. They started immediately on another one for Racer.  His went much faster because they had worked out the method and the details.  In the evening the wind picked up and shifted, bringing a sharp norther that was fast blowing the clouds south. As twilight turned to dark, the sky was almost clear, but it was much colder. They planned to leave in the morning, and both of them decided to go through their things to lighten their load. The pack baskets had been bigger and it was a tighter fit in the new pack-saddle carriers. No matter how they tried to arrange it, there just wasn't as much room. Some things had to go. They spread everything out that both of them were carrying.  Ayla pointed to the slab of ivory on which Talut had carved the map showing the first part of their Journey. "We don't need that any more.  Talut's land is far behind us," she said, feeling a touch of sadness.  "You're right, we don't need it. I hate to leave it, though," Jondalar said, grimacing at the thought of getting rid of it. "It would be inter esting to show the kind of maps the Mamutoi make, and it reminds w of Talut." Ayla nodded with understanding. "Well, if you have the room, ta^ it, but it isn't essential." , Jondalar glanced at Ayla's array spread out on the floor, and p10", j up the mysterious wrapped package he had seen before. "What is this. jj something I made last winter," she said, taking it out of his looking away quickly as a flush rose to her face. She put it shoving it under the pile of things she was taking.

She was grateful they had found i they did.  mtinued west toward the Sister River, dropping down a other level terrace, though they were still high enough in > see the wide grasslands of the steppes on the other side of ait waterway they were approaching. It gave them a per- the region as well as showing the extent of the river flood- 1. The level land that was usually under water during times is about ten miles across, but broader on the far bank. The the near side limited the floodwaters' normal expansion, re were elevations, hills and bluffs, across the river, too.  sst to the grasslands, the floodplain was a wilderness of mall lakes, woods, and tangled undergrowth with the river hrough it. Though it lacked meandering channels, it re- ^la of the tremendous delta of the Great Mother River, but a" scale. The sallows and seasonal brush that seemed to be t of the water along the edges of the swiftly flowing stream  indicated both the amount of flooding caused by the recent rains a the sizable portion of land already given up to the river.  Ayla's attention was brought back to her immediate surroundin when Whinney's gait suddenly changed, caused by her hooves sink; into sand. The small streams that had cut across the terraces above h a become deeply entrenched riverbeds between shifting dunes of sand marl. The horses floundered as they proceeded, kicking up fountain of loose, calcium-rich soil with each step.  Near evening, as the setting sun, nearly blinding in its intensity approached the earth, the man and woman, trying to shade their eyes' peered ahead, looking for a place to make camp. Drawing nearer to the floodplain, they noticed that the fine shifting sand was developing a slightly different character. Like the upper terraces, it was primarily loess—rock dust created by the grinding action of the glacier and de posited by the wind—but occasionally the river's flooding was extreme enough to reach their elevation. The clayey silt that was added to the soil hardened and stabilized the ground. When they began to see fa miliar steppe grasses growing beside the stream they were following, one of the many that were racing down the mountain toward the Sister, they decided to stop.  After they set up their tent, the woman and man went in separate directions to hunt for their dinner. Ayla took Wolf, who ran ahead and in a short time flushed up a covey of ptarmigan. He pounced on one as Ayla whipped out her sling and brought down another that thought it had reached the safety of the sky. She considered allowing Wolf to keep the bird he had caught, but when he resisted giving it up at once, she decided against it. Though one fat fowl could-certainly have satis fied both her and Jondalar, she wanted to rei^orce to the wolf the understanding that, when she expected it, he would have to share his kills with them, because she didn't know what lay ahead.  She didn't fully reason it out, but the nippy air had made her realize that they would be traveling during the cold season into an unknown land. The people she had known, both the Clan and the Mamutoi, seldom traveled very far during the severe glacial winters. They settled into a place that was secure from bitter cold and wind-driven blizzards, and they ate food they had stored. The idea of traveling in winter made her uneasy. , Jondalar's spear-thrower had found a large hare, which they decided to save for later. Ayla wanted to roast the birds on a spit over a nre, but they were camped on the open steppes, beside a stream with only scanty brush beside it. Looking around, she^pied a couple of antle ' unequal in size and obviously from different animals, that had bee the previous year. Though antler was much harder to break 1 with Jondalar's help, sharp flint knives, and the small axe i'his belt, they broke them apart. Ayla used part to skewer and the broken-off tines became forks to support the spit.  the effort, she decided she would keep them to use again, since antler was slow to catch fire.  re Wolf his share of the cooked fowl, along with a portion of e reed roots she had dug from a backwater ditch beside the id the meadow mushrooms that she recognized as edible and er their evening meal, they sat next to the fire and watched aw dark.

"Remember Brecie's throwing stick? I wish I knew how to use something like that. She could brine d several birds at one time with it." The night cooled quickly, and they were glad for the tent. Thoi nk?  Ay la had seemed unusually silent, full of sadness and rememberi she was warmly responsive to his touch, and Jondalar soon stonr"!  worrying about her quiet mood.    In the morning the air was still brisk, and the condensed moisting had brought a ghostly shimmer of frost to the land again. The icv stream was cold but invigorating when they used it to wash. They had buried Jondalar's hare, encased in its furry hide, under the hot coals to cook overnight. When they peeled off the blackened skin, the rich layer of winter fat just underneath had basted the usually lean and often stringy meat, and slow cooking within its natural container made it moist and tender. It was the best time of the year to hunt the lone- eared animals.  They rode side by side through the tall ripe grass, not rushing but keeping a steady pace, talking occasionally. Small game was plentiful as they headed toward the Sister, but the only large animals they saw all morning were across the river in the distance: a small band of male mammoths, heading north. Later in the day they saw a mixed herd of horses and saiga antelope, also on the other side. Whinney and Racer noticed them, too.  "Iza's totem was the Saiga," Ayla said. "That was a very powerful totem for a woman. Even stronger than Creb's birth totem, the Roe Deer. Of course, the Cave Bear had chosen him and was his second totem before he became Mog-ur." "But your totem is the Cave Lion. That's a much more powerful animal than a saiga antelope," Jondalar said. ff "I know. It's a man's totem, a hunter's totem. Thaffi why it was so hard for them to believe it, at first," Ayla said. "I don't really remember, but Iza told me that Brun even got angry at Creb when he named it at my adoption ceremony. That's why everyone was sure I would never have any children. No man had a totem powerful enough to defeat the Cave Lion. It was a big surprise when I got pregnant with Durc, but I'm sure it was Broud who started him, when he forced me." She frowned at the unpleasant thought. "And if totem spirits have something to do with starting babies, Broud's totem was the Woolly Rhinoceros. I remember the Clan hunters talking about a woolly rhino that killed a cave lion, so it could have been strong enough, and, like Broud, they can be mean."., "Woolly rhinos are unpredictable and can be vicious," Jondalar sal  I I was gored by one not far from here.

Marthona thinks that's why he likes to travel so much n can't fly like the eagle, but he has a need to see the land." "That's a powerful totem, like the Cave Lion, or the Cave Bear " Ay la commented. "Creb always said that powerful totems were nor easy to live with, and it's true, but I have been given so much. He even sent you to me. I think I have been very lucky. I hope the Cave Lion will be lucky for you, Jondalar. He is also your totem now." Jondalar smiled. "You've said that before." "The Cave Lion chose you, and you have the scars to prove it. Just as Willomar was marked by his totem." Jondalar looked thoughtful for a moment. "Perhaps you are right. I hadn't thought of it that way." Wolf, who had been off exploring, suddenly appeared. He yipped to get Ayla's attention, then fell into place beside Whinney. She watched him, tongue lolling out of the side of his-mouth, ears perked up, running with the wolfs usual untiring, ground-covering pace through the standing hay, which sometimes hid him from view. He seemed so happy and alert. He loved to go off and explore on his own, but he always returned, which made her happy. Riding with the man and the stallion beside her made her happy, too.  "From the way you always talk about him, I think your brother must have been like the man of his hearth," Ayla said, resuming the conversation. "Thonolan liked to travel, too, didn'the? Did he look like Willomar?" If "Yes, but not as much as I resemble Dalanar. Everyone remarks on it. Thonolan had a lot more of Marthona in him," Jondalar smiled, "but he was never chosen by an eagle, so that doesn't explain his travel urge." The smile faded. "My brother's scars were from that unpredictable woolly rhinoceros." He was thoughtful for a while. "But then Thonolan always was a bit unpredictable. Maybe it was his totem,." didn't seem to be very lucky for him, although the Sharamudoi did find us, and I never saw him as happy as he was after he met Jetamio- "I don't think the Woolly Rhino is a lucky totem," Ayla said, "but^ think the Cave Lion is.

He was protective of her and not at all uneasy when her Clan background came out when they were with the Sharamudoi, but he must have had some reason for feeling that way in the first place.  Well, she loved Jondalar and wanted to live with him, and besides.  it was too late now to change her mind, but she hoped she had done the right thing in coming with him. She wished once again that her Cave Lion totem would give her a sign so that she would know she had made the right decision, but no sign seemed to be forthcoming, i As the travelers neared the turbulent expanse of water at the conflu- ence of the Sister River with the Great Mother River, the loose, crum bly marls—sands and clays rich in calcium—of the upper terraces gave way to gravels and loess soils on the low levels. | In that wintry world, glaciered mountain crests filled streams and : rivers during the warmer season with meltwater. Near the end of the season, with the addition of heavy rains that accumulated as snow in the higher elevations, which sharp temperature changes could release suddenly, the swift streams became torrential floods. With no lakes on the western face of the mountains to hold back the gathering deluge in a natural reservoir and dole the outpour in more measured tribute, the increasing tide fell over itself down the steep sloASts. The cascading waters gouged sand and gravel out of the sandstones, limestones, and shales of the mountains, which was washed down to the mighty nver and deposited on the beds and floodplains.  The central plains, once the floor of an inland sea, occupier a Dasln between two massive mountain ranges on the east and west and higu' lands to the north and south. Almost equal in volume to the burgeon ing Mother as she neared their meeting, the swollen Sister held the drainage of part of the plains, and the entire western face of the mou tain chain that curved around in a great arc toward the northwest. 1 Sister River raced along the lowest depression of the basin to deliv her offering of floodwater to the Great Mother of Rivers, but b surging current was rebuffed by the higher water level of the mo til ^ already filled to capacity.

After a while lr slowed down again, but not to the leisurely pace they had maintain.^ before.  Jondalar stopped occasionally and studied the river and its far bank t before continuing north, glancing at the sky anxiously. The river did i seem narrower in some places and wider in others, but it was so full ) and broad that it was hard to tell for sure. They rode- until it was nearly dark without finding a suitable crossing place, but Jondalar insisted that they ride to higher ground to make camp for the nieht and they halted only when it became too dark to travel safely.    "Ayla! Ayla! Wake up!" Jondalar said, shaking her gently. "We have to get moving." "What? Jondalar! What's wrong?" Ayla said.  She was usually awake before him, and she felt disconcerted to be awakened so early. When she moved the sleeping fur aside, she felt a chill breeze, and then she noticed the tent flap was open. The diffused radiance of seething clouds was outlined by the opening, providing the only illumination inside their sleeping quarters. She could barely make out Jondalar's face in the dim gray light, but it was enough to see that he was worried, and she shivered with foreboding.  "We have to go," Jondalar said. He had hardly slept all night. He couldn't exactly say why he felt they had to get across the river as soon as possible, but the feeling was so strong that it gAs him a knot of fear in the pit of his stomach, not for himself, but for Ayla.  She got up, not asking why. She knew he would not have awakened her if he didn't think their situation was serious. She dressed quickly, then got out her fire-making kit.  "Let's not take the time for a fire this morning," Jondalar said.  She frowned, then nodded and poured out cold water for them to drink. They packed while eating cakes of traveling food. When they were ready to leave, Ayla looked for Wolf, but he was not in camp.  "Where is Wolf," Ayla said, a note of desperation in her voice.  "He's probably hunting. He'll catch up with us, Ayla. He always does.".  "I'll whistle for him," she said, then pierced the early morning a"' with the distinctive sound she used to call him.  [i Ayla.

Then, g Wolf to stay close, she followed Jondalar and Racer.  6 was no sunrise. The day just kept getting imperceptibly but never bright. The cloud cover hung low, giving the sky a i gray, and there was a cool dampness in the air. Later in the ; they stopped to rest. Ayla made a hot tea to warm them, then oup out of a cake of traveling food. She added lemony sorrel ind wild rose hips, after removing the seeds and the sharp Mirs from inside, and a few leaves from the tips of the clump roses growing nearby.

I "Do you think we should try to ride the horses across?" Tondal asked, glancing nervously at the threatening sky.  Ayla studied the racing river and the debris it carried along. Often large whole trees floated by, along with many broken ones, that had been washed down from stands higher in the mountains. She shod.  dered when she noticed a large, bloated deer carcass, its antlers caught and entwined in the branches of a tree that was lodged near the shore. \softline The dead animal made her fear for the horses. } "I think it would be easier for them to cross if we are not on their backs," she said. "I think we should swim beside them." "That's what I thought," Jondalar said.  "But we'll need a rope to hold on," she said.  They got out short lengths of rope, then checked over the harnesses and baskets to make sure their tent, food, and few precious belongings were secure. Ayla unhitched the travois from Whinney, deciding it might be too dangerous for her to try to swim the tumultuous river in full harness, but they did not want to lose the poles and bowl boat, if they could help it.  With that in mind, they bound the long poles together with cordage.  While Jondalar fastened one end to the sidfe of the bowl boat, Ayla secured the other end to the harness that was used to hold on Whin ney's pack-saddle basket. She used a slip knot that could readily be released if she felt it was necessary. Then, to the flat braided cord that went down around behind the mare's front legs and up across her chest, used to hold Ayla's riding blanket on the mare,' the woman attached another rope, much more securely.  Jondalar attached a similar rope to Racer; then he took off his boots, his inner foot-coverings, and his heavy outer clothes and furs. When soaked, they would weigh him down, making swimming all but imp08' sible. He wrapped them together and piled them on top of the pac saddle, but he kept his under tunic and leggings on. Even when we i the leather would provide some warmth. Ayla did the same.  The animals sensed the urgency and anxiety of the humans and we disturbed by the roiling water.

Wolf, on the other hand, had gone to the edge of the dvesrigate the deer, but he didn't go in.  |o you think the horses will do, Ayla?"Jondalar asked, as big adrops began to fall.  re nervous, but I think they'll be all right, especially since we th them, but I'm not so sure about Wolf," Ayla said.  n't carry him across.

"Easy now, Racer," the man said.

Ayla whistled to him and, ' more false starts, he finally plunged in and started paddling 'r. She turned her attention back to the horse and the river The rain, coming down harder, seemed to flatten out the waves in the distance, but nearby the wild water was even mo^ tered with debris than she had thought. Broken trunks and bra iZ3 swirled around or bumped into her, some still with leaves ntk^ waterlogged and almost hidden. The bloated animals were' w1^ often torn open by the violence of the flood that had caught them 1!2 swept them down the mountain and into the muddy river. | She saw several birch mice and pine voles. A large ground sauinrf1 was harder to recognize; its pale brown pelt was dark and the thick flurry tail was plastered down. A collared lemming, long white winter hair, lank but shiny, growing out through fur of summer gray that looked black, showed the bottom of its feet already covered with white fur. It had probably come from high on the mountain near the snow The large animals showed more damage. A chamois floated past with a horn broken off and the fur gone from half its face, exposing pinkish muscle. When she saw the carcass of a young snow leopard, she looked back again for Wolf, but he was not in sight. : She noticed, however, that the rope dragging behind the mare was hauling along a snag as well as the poles and boat. The broken stump with spreading roots was adding an unnecessary burden and slowing Whinney down. Ay la pulled and tugged on the rope, trying to bring it closer to her, but it suddenly came loose by itself. A small forked branch was still clinging, but it was nothing to worry about. She was concerned about not seeing any sign of Wolf, even though she was so low in the water that she couldn't see much. It upset her, especially since there was nothing she could do about it. She whistled for him once, but she wondered if he would hear it al&ye the noise of the rushing water.  She turned back and took a critical look at Whinney, worried that the heavy snag might have tired her, but she was still swimming strongly. Ayla looked ahead and was relieved to see Racer withjonda- lar bobbing along beside him. She kicked and pulled with her'free arm, trying not to be a greater burden than she had to be. But as they continued, more and more she just hung on to the rope, beginning to shiver. She began to feel that it was taking an unreasonably long tune to cross the river. The opposite shore still seemed so far ahead. 1 shivering wasn't too bad at first, but with more time in the cold water.  it became more intense and wouldn't stop. Her muscles were becoinu1?  very tense, and her teeth were chattering. < i She looked back for Wolf again, but she still did not see ""jj should go back for him, he's so cold, she thought, as she shive'• -^ violently.

It felt so good to close her Irest. A ryla was almost unconscious when she felt the solid stones J the riverbed under her. She tried to stumble to her feet as Whinnert dragged her across the rocky bottom, taking a few steps onto a beaA of smooth round stones at a bend in the river. Then she fell. The rooe.  still tightly wrapped around her hand, jerked her around and halted the horse. ; Jondalar, too, had shivered through the first stages of hypothennit while crossing the river, but he had reached the opposite shore sooner than she, before he became too uncoordinated or irrational. She would have made it across more quickly, but so much debris had gotten caught up in Whinney's rope that it had slowed the horse considerably.  Even Whinney was beginning to suffer from the cold river before the slip knot, though swollen from the water, finally worked itself loose, freeing her from the encumbering weight.  Unfortunately, when he first reached the other side, the cold had affected Jondalar enough so that he wasn't entirely coherent. He pulled his outer fur parka over his wet clothing and started out to lode for Ayla, on foot, leading the stallion, but he headed in the wrong direction along the river's edge. The exercise waraied him and cleared away the confusion. They had both been carried downstream for some distance, but since she had taken longer to get across, she had to be farther downriver. He turned around and walked back. When Racer nickered and he heard an answering whinny, he started to run' ' inr When Jondalar saw Ayla, she was lying on her back on the rocky shore, beside the patient mare, her arm held up by the rope entangled around her hand. He rushed to her, his heart racing with fear. After first making sure she was still breathing, he gathered her up in his arms and held her close, tears filling his eyes.  "Ayla! Ayla! You're alive!" he cried. "I was so afraid you were gone.  But you're so cold!" j He had to get her warm. He loosened the rope from her hand picked her up. She stirred and opened her eyes.

"Just try to find him," she said, but as he started to mo away, she clung to him.  He wasn't sure if he had really planned to search for the wolf wh he first started to get up. He had wanted to get some wood for a fire get some warm tea or soup into her and see to the horses, but he h promised. Racer and Whinney were standing within the grove ofw lows, their riding blankets and Racer's halter still on, but the stun animals seemed fine for the moment, so he headed down the slope.  He didn't know which direction to go when he reached the rm but he finally decided to try downstream. Pulling his hood down fs ther to keep off the rain, he started hiking along the bank, checldi through piles of driftwood and concentrations oFdebris. He fom many dead animals and saw as many carnivores and scavengers, go four-legged and winged, feasting on the river's leavings, even a pack southern wolves, but none that looked like Wolf.  Finally he turned around and headed back. He would go upstrea a way, but he doubted if he'd have any better luck. He didn't real expect to find the animal, and he realized that it saddened him. W( could be troublesome sometimes, but he had developed a real affecrif for the intelligent beast. He would miss him, at® he knew Ayla wou be distraught.  He reached the rocky shore where he had found Ayla and walla around the bend, not sure how far he ought to go in the other direcna especially when he noticed that the river was rising. He decided tin would move the tent farther away from the river as soon <s Ayla w fit to travel. Maybe I ought to forget about looking upstream and raw sure she is all right, he said to himself, hesitating. Well, maybe IU( a short distance; she'll ask if I searched in both directions.  He started up the river, working his way around a pile of logs branches, but when he saw the majestic silhouette of an icaperiw ^v gliding on outstretched wings, he stopped and watched witn Suddenly the large, graceful bird folded his powerful win^^ dropped rapidly to the bank of the river, then swooped up again a large suslik hanging from its talons.. i^ A little farther on, where the bird had found its meal, ah - 370 S mine int0 a sl^ht delta, added its share to the waters of thought he saw something familiar on the wide stretch t where they came together, and he smiled with recog- tfae bowl boat, but when he looked closer, he frowned lining toward it. Beside the boat, Ayla was sitting in the Wolfs head in her lap. A wound above his left eye was lood.  Sat are you doing here? How did you get here?" he 6 in fear and worry than in anger.

He lifted the wolf from her lap and then tried to ' steps, he knew they were going to have a difficult time k to the tent. Ayla was hardly able to walk, and the wolf heavy animal. His waterlogged fur added even more man could not carry both of them, and he knew Ayla let him leave Wolf and come back for him later.

't even reached the pile of driftwood and he was already tiring from the effort. He was holding his own exhaustion off by sh effort of will. He, too, had swum the mighty river, and then h^ carried Ay la up the slope and set up the tent. And then he had tramrw^ up and down the riverbank searching for the wolf. When he heard neigh, he looked up. Relief and joy flooded through him at the sight nf the two horses.  He laid the wolf across Whinney's back, since she had carried him before and was used to it; then he helped Ayla up on Racer and led him toward the rocky beach. Whinney followed. Ayla, shivering in her wet clothes as the rain began to pour down harder, had trouble staying on the horse when they started up the slope. But, taking it slowly, they made it back to the tent near the grove of trees.  Jondalar helped Ayla down and got her into the tent, but hypothermia was making her irrational again and she was getting hysterical about the wolf. He had to bring him in immediately, then had to promise he would dry him off. He searched through the packs for something with which to rub him down. But when she wanted to bring him into their sleeping roll, he adamantly refused, though he did find a cover for him. While she sobbed uncontrollably, he helped Ayla undress and wrapped her with the furs.  He went out again, removed Racer's halter and the riding blankets from both horses, patted them gratefully, and gave them some words of thanks. Even though horses normally lived outside in all kinds of weather, and were adapted to the cold, he knew they didn't care much for rain, and he hoped they would not suffer for it. Then, finally, Jondalar went into the tent, undressed, aft crawled in beside the violently shaking woman. Ayla huddled closcro Wolf, while Jondalar cuddled her back, wrapping himself around her. After a time, with the warming body of a wolf on one side and the man on the other, the woman's shaking stopped, and they both gave in to their exhaustion and fell asleep.    Ayla woke up to a wet tongue licking her face. She pushed Won away, smiling with joy, then hugged him. Holding his head between her hands, she looked at his wound closely. The rain had washed the dirt away from the injury, and he had stopped bleeding. Though s" wanted to treat him with some medicines later, he seemed fine to now. It wasn't so much the bump on the head, but the cold river tti had weakened him. Sleep and warmth had been the best medicii^- She became conscious that Jondalar had his arms around her, ^ though he was sleeping, and she lay still being held and holding w ' ' listening to the rain drumming on the tent.  he remembering bits and pieces of the day before: stumbling Re brush and driftwood, searching the riverbank for Wolf; Blurtinr because the rope wrapped around it had become so Efllar carrying her.

"Jondalar, why are you blaming yourself?" Ayla asked. "You are not stupid. You could not foresee what would happen. Not even One Who Serves the Mother can do it very well. It's never clear. And y» did make it. We're here now, and everyone is all right, thanks to you, including Wolf. We even have the boat, and who knows how useful that might still be." "But I almost lost you," he said, burying his head i;i her neck and clutching her so hard that it hurt, though she did not stop him. "I can't tell you how much I love you. I care about you so much, but the wordt that say it are so small. They are not enough to say what I feel for you." He held her close as if he thought that by holding her tight enough, he could somehow make her part of him, and would therefore never lose her.  She held him tightly, too, loving him and wishing she could do something to relieve his anguish and suddenly otwwhelming need.  Then she realized she knew what to do. She breathed in his ear and kissed his neck. His response was immediate. He kissed her with ; fierce passion, caressing her arms and molding her breasts in his hands, sucking on her nipples with a hungry need. She put her leg aroun" him, and rolled him over on top of her, then opened her thighs, "c backed away, prodding and groping with his full member, trying to find her opening.

The conversation had put him in the mood to ---- about getting on their way, although they wouldn't be leaving unr'I"!  following morning. He was rested and relaxed, and he didn't feel i^i staying in bed any more. ^a "We won't be crossing many rivers at all until we reach the hiehl nj.  to the north," he continued. "At least, that's what Haduma's n^m?  told me. They say there are a few hills, but it's pretty flat count-^, Most of the rivers we'll see will be channels of the Mother. Thev^ she wanders all over the place through here. It's good hunting ground^ though. Haduma's people cross the channels all the time to hunt here" "Haduma's people?

Tonda.  lar hesitated, thinking about the First Rites he had shared with the pretty young woman, Noria. Ayla noticed a strange expression as though he was slightly embarrassed, but also pleased with himself.  "... Ceremony, a festival," he finished.  "A festival to honor the Great Earth Mother?" Ayla asked.  "Ah... yes, as a matter of fact. They asked me. 7. ah, they asked Thonolan and me, to share it with them." "Are we going to visit Haduma's people?" Ayla said from the opening, holding a Sharamudoi chamois skin to dry herself with after she washed in the creek by the willows.  "I'd like to, but I don't know where they live," Jondalar said. Then, seeing her puzzled expression, he quickly explained. "Some of their hunters found our camp, and then they sent for Haduma. She was the one who decided to have the festival, and she senTSw the rest." He paused, thinking back. "Haduma was quite a woman. She was the oldest person I've ever met. Even older than Mamut. She's the mother of six generations." At least I hope so, he thought. "I really would like to see her again, but we can't take the time to look for them. I imagine she's dead by now, anyway, although her son, Tamen, would still be alive. He was the only one who spoke Zeiandonii." Ayla went out, and Jondalar was feeling a strong need to pass his water. He quickly pulled his tunic over his head and went outside, too. While he was holding his member, watching the steaming arco strong-smelling yellow water pouring on the ground, he wondered Noria ever did have the baby Haduma said she would, and 11 ul organ he was holding was responsible for it.  He noticed Ayla heading toward the willows with only the chafflo.  skin thrown over her shoulders. He supposed he ought to go and w3 ah he'd had his fill of cold water today. It wasn't that he ;t into it, if he had to, crossing the river, for example, but it led that washing frequently in cold water was so important is traveling with his brother.  yasn't that Ayla ever said anything to him, but since she ?ld water stop her, he felt he could hardly use that as an wid washing himself--and he had to admit he liked the fact ually smelled so fresh. But sometimes she actually broke to reach water, and he wondered how she stood it so cold.  the was up and around.

They headed northwest, al- ir route was far from direct. The central plains resembled to the east and were in fact an extension of them, but the rsing the ancient basin from north to south played a domi- in the character of the land. The frequently changing, and widely meandering course of the Great Mother River, ir, created enormous wetlands with the vast dry grasslands.  lakes developed in the sharply curved bends of the larger iat sprawled over the land, and the marshes, wet meadows, elds that gave diversity to the magnificent steppes were a nbelievable numbers and varieties of birds, but they also >urs for land-bound travelers.

Rather than stunted dwarf.; brush and trees that crowded close to watercourses were often full and filled out. In the southeastern section, near the broad turbul confluence, bogs and swamps stood in valleys and hollows, and A became enormous during flood seasons. Small soggy fen wood^ alder, ash, and birch mired the unwary between knolls capped w.a groves of willow, occasionally spiced with oak and beech, while oima took root in sandier soils. ^ Most soils were either a mixture of rich loess and black loams » sands and alluvial gravels, with an occasional outcrop of ancient roA interrupting the flat relief. Those isolated highlands were usually fos ested with conifers, which sometimes extended down to the plain.  providing a place for several species of animals that could not live or the open ground exclusively; life was richest at the margins. But wiA all the complexity, the primary vegetation was still grass. Tallgrass and short steppe grasses and herbs, feather grasses and fescues, the cental steppic plains were an extraordinarily rich, abundantly productive grassland blowing in the wind. ^ s As Ayla and Jondalar left the southern plains and approached tfat cold north, the season seemed to progress more quickly than usuali The wind in their faces carried a hint of the earth-chilling cold of hi source. The inconceivably massive accumulation of glacial ice, stretch ing over vast areas of northern lands, lay directly in front of them, within a walking distance much less than they had already traveled.  With the changing season, the increasing force of the icy air held l deep undercurrent of its potential power. The rains diminished and finally ceased altogether as ragged streaks of white replacecwhe thun- derheads, the clouds torn to shreds by the strong steady wmus. Sharp blasts tore the dry leaves from deciduous trees and scattered them in » loose carpet at their feet. Then, in a sudden change of mood, a sudden updraft lifted the brittle skeletons of summer growth, churned them around furiously and, tiring of the game, resettled them Hi another place.  But the dry, cold weather was more to the travelers' liking, familial even comfortable with their fur-lined hoods and parkas. Jondalar wa been told correctly; hunting was easy in the central plains and animals were fat and healthy after a summer of eating. It was also time of year when many grains, fruits, nuts, and roots were "P0.  harvesting. They had no need to use their emergency traveling r and they even replenished supplies they had used when they ki11 , giant deer, then decided to stop and rest for a few days while ' dried the meat.

Most waterways ran parallel -south direction of the Great Mother River, though they oueh some that crossed the plain, but the patterns were ble. The channels meandered so widely they weren't always earn running across their path was a turn in the river or one streams coming down from higher ground.

I they sometimes had to detour from their northerly direction fa wide swing of the river, it was the kind of open grassland i traveling on horseback such an advantage over traveling on y made exceptionally good time, covering such long distances fethat they made up for previous delays. Jondalar was pleased Ithat they were even compensating, somewhat, for his decision he long way around so they could visit the Sharamudoi.  ilrisp, cold, clear days gave them a wide panoramic view, oh- Inly by morning mists when the sun warmed the condensed )hfrom the night to above freezing. To the east now were the ibs they had skirted when they followed the great river across southern plains, the same mountains over whose southwest hey had climbed. The glistening glaciered peaks moved imper- ' closer as the range curved toward the northwest in a great leir left, the highest chain of mountains on the continent, bear- avy crown of glacial ice that reached halfway down its flanks, I in ridges from east to west. The towering, shining peaks .n the purple distance as a vaguely sinister presence, an appar- sunnountable barrier between the travelers and their ultimate ^n. The Great Mother River would take them around the Mthem face of the range to a relatively small glacier that cov- ith an armor of ice, an ancient rounded massif at the north- end of the alpine foreland of the mountains.  r and closer, beyond a grassy plain broken up by pine woods, niassif rose. The granite highland overlooked steppe meadows Mother, but gradually decreased as they continued north, ? into the rolling hills that continued all the way to the foothills of the western mountains. Fewer and fewer trees broke the oi- of the grassy landscape, and those that did began to take on the f dwarfed contortions of trees sculptured by wind.    Ayla and Jondalar had traveled nearly three-quarters of the distance, from south to north, of the immense central plains before'^.  first snow flurries began.  "Jondalar, look! It's snowing!" Ayla said, and her smile was radiant "It's the first snow of winter." She had been smelling snow in the air I and the first snow of the season always seemed special to her. 'I "I can't understand why you look so happy about it," he said huy^ her smile was contagious and he couldn't help smiling back. "You'tt going to be very tired of snow, and ice, before we see the last of it I'm afraid." "You're right, I know, but I still love the first snow." After a few more paces, she asked, "Can we make camp soon?" "It's only a little past noon," Jondalar said, looking puzzled. "Why1 are you talking about making camp already?" "I saw some ptarmigan a little while ago. They have started to turn white, but with no snow on the ground, they are easy to see right now.  They won't be after it snows, and they always taste so good this time of year, especially the way Creb liked them, but it takes a long time to cook them that way." She was remembering, looking off into the distance.  "You have to dig a hole in the ground, line it with rocks, and build a fire in it, then put the birds in, all wrapped in hay, cover them up, and then wait." The words had tumbled out of her mouth so fast, she almost tripped over them. "But it's worth the wait." "Slow down, Ayla. You're all excited," he said, smiling with ionise- ment and delight. He loved to watch her when she was filled wim such enthusiasm. "If you are sure they will be that delicious, then I guess we ought to make an early camp, and go hunt ptarmigan." "Oh, they will be," she said, looking at Jondalar with a serious expression, "but you've eaten them that way. You know how' they taste." Then she noticed his smile and realized he had been playing with her. She pulled her sling out of her waistband. "You make camp.  I'll hunt ptarmigan, and if you'll help me dig the hole, I'll even let you taste one," she said, grinning as she urged Whinney on.  "Ayla!" Jondalar called before she got very far. "If you leave me the pole drag, I'll have camp all set up for you, 'Woman Who Hunts.  She looked startled.

She walked over the area and picked a ked right for the ground oven. "Over here," she said, "not |in these stones." She scanned the beach, deciding that she ivell pick out some nice round stones for her sling while she paled Wolf to come with her and backtracked along their img for the ptarmigan she had sighted. Once she started look- Jl fat birds, she saw several species that resembled them. She led first by the covey of gray partridges she saw pecking at N|sds of ryegrass and einkom wheat. She identified the sur- large number of young by their slightly less defined mark- Ay their size. Though the middle-size stocky birds laid as JBventy eggs in a clutch, they were usually subject to such Klation that not many survived to adulthood.  totridges were also flavorful, but Ayla decided she would tin, keeping their location in mind in case she didn't find the t-she had a taste for. A flock, several family coveys, of smaller | quails startled her as they took to wing. The rotund little IB tasty, too, and if she had known how to use a throwing could bring down several at one time, she might have tried "c had decided to pass by the others, Ayla was glad to see y well camouflaged ptarmigan near the place she had seen yre- Though they still showed some patterning on their backs 81 tnelr predominantly white feathers made them stand out  against.the grayish ground and dark gold dry grass. The fat ^^"i birds had already grown winter feathers on their legs, extendin "^l to their feet for both warmth and for use as snowshoes. Though ^^1 often traveled longer distances, both partridge and ptanniean a-' grouse that turned white in snow, normally stayed within a (Tpno-.S area close to their birthplace, migrating only a short distance betw winter and summer ranges.  In the way of that wintry world, which allowed close associations rf living things whose habitats would at other times be far apart eaA had its niche and both would stay on the central plains through thr winter. While the partridge kept to the windblown open grassland- eating seeds and roosting at night in trees near rivers and highlands.  the ptarmigan would stay in the drifting snow, burrowing out snow caves to keep warm, and living on twigs, shoots, and buds of brush.  often varieties containing strong oils that were distasteful or even poi sonous to other animals. ; Ayla signaled Wolf to stay while she picked out two stones from her pouch and readied her sling. From Whinney's back, she sighted on one nearly white bird and hurled the first stone. Wolf, understanding her motion as a signal, dashed for another bird at the same time. With « burst of wings and loud squawks of protest, the rest of the covey of heavy birds took to the air, their large flight muscles beating strongly.  Their normal camouflaged markings on the ground made a startling change in the air when erect plumage displayed distinct patterns, mak ing it easier for others of their kind to follow and keep together in a flock.  After the impetus of the first surge of activity and sudden flay of feathers, the flight of the ptarmigan eased into a long glide. With a pressure and movement of her body that was second nature, Ayla signaled Whinney to follow the birds, while she prepared to throw a second stone. The young woman grabbed the sling on the downstroke, slid her hand down to the loose end, and, with a smooth practiced action that moved with the motion, she brought it back to her throwing hand and dropped the second stone in the pocket before she let go- Though she sometimes took an extra swing for the first cast, she sel dom required the buildup of momentum for her second throw.  Her ability to cast stones so quickly was such a difficult skill ttia» had she asked, she would have been told it was impossible. But tn was no one for her to ask, no one to tell her it couldn't be done, Ayla had taught herself the double-stone technique.

The horse was actually shaking, and the lerstood why. A -yla sat on Whinney's back staring ahead, feeling an unar. countable apprehension, a fear welling up inside that sent a chill un her spine. She closed her eyes and shook her head to dispel the sensation.  After all, there was nothing to fear. Opening her eyes, she looked again at the large herd of horses in front of them. What was so fearsome about a herd of horses?  Most of the horses were looking in their direction, and Whinney's attention was just as intensely focused on the other members of her species as they were on her. Ayla signaled Wolf to stay, noticing that he was very curious and overly eager to investigate. -Horses, after all, were often prey to wolves, and the wild ones wouldn't like it if he got too close.  As Ayla studied the herd more closely, not quite sure what they or Whinney would do, she realized that it was not one, but two different herds. Dominating the area were the mares with their young, and Ayla assumed that the one standing aggressively forward of the others was the lead mare. In the background was a smaller herd of bachelors.  Suddenly she noticed one standing between them, and then she couldn't help staring. It was the most unusual horse she lAd ever seen. w Most horses were variations of Whinney's shade of dun yellow, some tending more to tans, some more pale. Racer's dark brown coloring was unusual, she had never seen another horse as dark, but the coloring of the herd stallion was just as strange in the other direction. She uaa never seen a horse as light. The mature, well-formed stallion approaching warily was pure white!  Before he noticed Whinney, the white had been keeping the other males at bay, making it clear that, if they didn't come too close, they might be tolerated since it was not the season for horses to mate, he was the only one who had the right to mingle with the females.  sudden appearance of a strange female, however, piqued his intere » and it caught the attention of the rest of the horses as well.  Horses, by nature, were social animals. They liked to associate r rses. Mares in particular tended to form permanent relation- (ut unlike the pattern of most herding animals, where the rs remained with their mothers in close kinship groups, horses f formed herds of unrelated mares. Young females usually left ^ group when they were fully mature, at about two years old.

Although they I each other in the bachelor herd, vying for dominance was the ;rivity.

It was only after fears in such associations that males were able to steal young or displace an established herd male.  unattached female who had wandered into their range, Whin- the object of intense interest on the part of both the female I the individual bachelors.

Ayla arrived back at camp, everything was ready for her.  had just finished erecting the three poles to keep the food ned out of the reach of most of the animals that might be inter- V.. The tent was up, the hole was dug and lined with rocks,  and he had even used some stones to make a boundary for the fi ^ place.  "Look at that island," he told her as she dismounted. He pointed t a stretch of land, built of accumulated silt, in the middle of the riv with sedge, reeds, and several trees growing on it. "There's a whol flock of storks over there, black ones and white ones. I watched them land," he said with a pleased smile. "I kept wishing you would come It was a sight worth seeing. They were diving and soaring, even flint ping over. They just folded their wings and dropped from the sky tn land; then when they were almost down, they opened their wings, h looked like they were heading south. They'll probably leave in the morning." Ay la looked across the water at the large, long-billed, long-legged stately birds. They were actively feeding, walking or running on the land or in the shallow water, snapping at anything that moved with their long, strong beaks, taking fish, lizards, frogs, insects, and earth worms. They even ate carrion, judging from the way they went after the remains of a bison washed up on the beach. The two species were quite similar in general shape, though different in coloring. The white storks had black-edged wings and there were more of them; the black storks had white underparts, and most of them were in the water after fish.  "We saw a big herd of horses on the way back," Ay la said, reaching for the ptarmigan and partridges. "A lot of mares and young ones, but a male was close by. The herd stallion is white." "White?" "As white as those white storks. He didn't even Hwe black legs," she said, unfastening the thongs of the pack-saddle basket. "You'd never see him in snow." "White is rare. I've never seen a white horse," Jondalar said. Then, thinking back to Noria and the First Rites ceremony, he recalled the white horsehide hanging on the wall behind the bed, decorated with the red heads of immature great spotted woodpeckers. "But I did once see the hide of a white horse," he said.  Something about the tone of his voice made Ayla look closer. He saw her look, blushed a little as he turned away to lift the carrier basket off Whinney, then felt compelled to explain further.  "It was during the... ceremony with the Hadumai." "Are they horse hunters?" Ayla asked. She folded the riding blanket, then picked up the birds and walked to the edge of the river.  "Well, they do hunt horses. Why?" Jondalar asked, walking along with her. iber Talut telling us about hunting the white mammoth? It sacred to the Mamutoi because they are the Mammoth Avia said.

"He was a Mamutoi," Ayla said. "I do miss the Lion Camp. I niisg the people. We haven't seen many people on this Journey. I didn't know how far you had traveled, Jondalar, or how much land there is.  So much land and so few people." As the sun moved closer to the earth, the clouds over the high mountains to the west were reaching up to embrace the fiery orb and glowing pink in their excitement. The brightness settled into the brilliant enveloping display, then faded into darkness while Ayla and Jondalar finished their meal. Ayla got up to put the extra birds away; she had cooked much more than they could eat. Jondalar put cooking stones back in the fire in preparation for their evening tea.  "They were delicious," Jondalar said. "I'm glad you wanted to stop early. It was worth it." Ayla happened to glance toward the island, and, ^wh a gasp, her eyes opened wide. Jondalar heard her startled intake"x>f breath, and looked up.  Several people carrying spears had appeared out of the gloom and stepped into the edge of the light by the fire. Two of them wore capes of horsehide, with the dried head still attached and worn over the head like a hood. Jondalar stood up. One of the men pulled his horse-head hood back and walked toward him.  "Zei-an-don-yee!" the man said, pointing at the tall blond man- Then he slapped himself on his chest. "Hadumai! Jeren!" He was grinning broadly. , Jondalar looked closely, then grinned back. "Jeren! Is that you.  Great Mother, I can't believe it! It is you." The man started talking in a language just as unintelligible to J° dalar as his was to Jeren, but the friendly smiles were understood^.  "Ayla!" Jondalar said, motioning her over. "This is Jeren. Hes | hunter who stopped us when we were heading the other n't believe it!" Both were still grinning with delight. Jeren Avia and his smile took on an appreciative gleam as he Jondalar.  this is Ayla, Ayla of the Mamutoi," Jondalar said, making reductions.

He put his spear into a holder slung across his back, her hands, and said, "Ayla," knowing it was her name, but ehending the rest of the words. He slapped himself on the i. "Jeren," he said, then added some unfamiliar words.  ie man jerked with sudden apprehension. He had seen a wolf yla's side.

He had igh a similar introduction many times when they had stayed >haramudoi, and he seemed to understand Ayla's intention.  » took Jeren's hand and, looking up at him, guided it toward head to let him feel the fur, showing him how to stroke id.

"That 1 idea, Ayla," he said.  l think they're hungry? We have a lot of food left," she said.  on't you offer it and see."

She left the men to divide up the meat as they wanted, while she got out a large wooden bowl, one she had made, and filled it with water for tea.  The men looked much more relaxed after the meal, even when Avh brought Wolf to sniff them. As they all sat around the fire holdine cups of tea, they tried to communicate beyond the level of smilinc friendliness and hospitality.  Jondalar started. "Haduma?" he asked.  Jeren shook his head and looked sad. He made a motion toward the ground with his hand that Ayla sensed meant she had returned to the Great Earth Mother. Jondalar understood as well that the old woman he had grown so fond of was gone.  "Tamen?" he asked.  Smiling, Jeren nodded in an exaggerated fashion. Then he pointed to one of the others and said something that included Tamen's name.  A young man, hardly more than a boy, smiled at them, and Jondalar saw a similarity to the man he had known.  "Tamen, yes," Jondalar said, smiling and nodding. "Tamen's son, or perhaps grandson, I think. I wish Tamen were hAc," he said to Ayla. "He knew some Zeiandonii, and we could talk aMittle. He made a long Journey there when he was a young man." Jeren looked around the camp, then at Jondalar, and said "Zei-an- don-yee... Ton... Tonolan?" This time Jondalar shook his head and looked sad. Then, thinking about it, he made the motion toward the ground. Jeren looked surprised, but he nodded and said a word that was a question. Jondalar didn't understand, and he looked at Ayla. "Do you know what hes asking?" Though the language was unfamiliar, there was a quality about most languages she had heard that felt familiar. Jeren said the wor again, and something about his expression or his tone gave her an idea- She held her hand in the shape of a claw and growled like a cave lion.  i ghe made was so realistic that all the men gaped at her 1 surprise, but Jeren nodded with understanding. He had honolan died, and she had told him. One of the other men as to Jeren. When Jeren responded, Jondalar heard an- r name, Noria. The one who asked smiled at the tall blond I at him, and then at his own eye, and smiled again.  lfelt a flush of excitement. Maybe it meant that Noria did »V with his blue eyes.

She stood between the two animals and tried to explain lotions and even the expressive Clan gestures that these were horses that should not be hunted, but neither she nor Jondalar re they understood. Jondalar was even concerned that they think she had some unique powers to Call horses and had t these expressly for them to hunt. He told Ayla that he thought "stration might help.  jot a spear from inside the tent and made motions with it as he were going to stab Racer, but Ayla stood barring the way  with her arms held up and crossed in front of her, shakine emphatically.

The visitor smiled at the wom--^ when Wolf sniffed at him and allowed himself to be petted again She tried to invite them to share their morning meal, but they left quickly.  "I wish I had known some of their language," Ayla said. "It was nice to visit, but we couldn't talk." "Yes, I wish we could have, too," Jondalar said, sincerely wishine that he had found out whether Noria ever did have a baby, and if it had his blue eyes.  "In the Clan, different clans used some words in their everyday language that weren't always understood by everyone, but everyone knew the silent language of gestures. You could always communicate," Ayla said. "Too bad the Others don't have a language everyone can understand." "It would be helpful, especially when you are on a Journey, but it's hard for me to imagine a language that everyone would understand.  Do you really think that people of the Clan everywhere can understand the same sign language?" Jondalar asked.  "It's not like a language they have to learn. They are born with it, Jondalar. It is so ancient that it is in their memories, and tpeir memories go back to the beginning. You can't imagine how far back that is," Ayla said.  She shivered with a chill of fear as she remembered the time that Creb, to save her life, had taken her back with them, against all tradition. By the unwritten law of the Clan, he should have let her die. But to the Clan, she was dead, now. It occurred to her how ironic that was. When Broud had cursed her with death, he shouldn't have. He didn't have a good reason. Creb did have a reason; she had broken the most powerful taboo of the Clan. Perhaps he should have made sure that she died, but he didn't.  They began striking camp and stowing their tent, sleeping rolls, cooking utensils, ropes, and other equipment in the pack-saddle ba kets, with the efficiency of unspoken routine.

Jeren cleared on the ground, then drew a line with the staff, and another } it. Below the first line, he drew a figure that vaguely resem- orse. At the end of the second line pointing toward the channel »reat Mother River, he drew a circle with a few lines radiating Ayla looked more closely.  »Iar," she said, with excitement in her voice, "when Mamut Wing me symbols and teaching me what they meant, that was m- 'sun.'

Jeren was nodding vigorously. Then he pointed north and frowned He walked to the north end of the line he had drawn and stood facin them. He lifted his arms and crossed them in front of him, in the sam way that Ayla had done when she was trying to tell Jeren not to hum Whinney and Racer. Then he shook his head no. Ayla and Jondalar looked at each other and back at Jeren.  "Do you think he's trying to tell us not to go north?" Ayla asked.  Jondalar felt a dawning recognition of what Jeren was trying to communicate. "Ayla, I don't think he just wants us to go south with him and visit. I think he's trying to tell us something more. I think he's trying to warn us not to go north." "Warn us? What could be north that he would warn us against?" Ayla said.  "Could it be the great wall of ice?" Jondalar wondered.  "We know about the ice. We hunted mammoth near it with the Mamutoi. It's cold, but not really dangerous, is it?" "It does move," Jondalar said, "over many years, and sometimes it even uproots trees with the changing seasons, but it doesn't move so fast that you can't get out of its way." "I don't think it's the ice," Ayla said. "But he's telling us not to go north, and he seems very concerned." "I think you're right, but I can't imagine what could be so danger ous," Jondalar said. "Sometimes people who don't travel much beyond their own range imagine that the world outside their/Ktritory is dan gerous, because it's different." "I don't think Jeren is a man who fears very much," Ayla said.  "I have to agree," Jondalar said, then faced the man. "Jeren, I wish I could understand you." Jeren had been watching them. He guessed from their expressions that they had understood his warning, and he was waiting for their response.  "Do you think we should go with him and talk to Tamen?" Ayla asked.  "I hate to turn back and lose time now. We still have to reach that glacier before the end of winter. If we keep going, we should make 1 easily, with time to spare, but if anything happens to delay us, it cou be spring and melting, and too dangerous to cross," Jondalar said.  "So we'll keep going north," Ayla said.  "I think we should, but we will be watchful. I just wish I knew wba >e watching for." He looked at the man again. "Jeren, my hank y011 ^or yo111' warning," he said. "We will be careful, k we should keep on going." He pointed south, then shook ad pointed north.  ying to protest, shook his head again, but he finally gave up d acceptance. He had done what he could. He went to talk er man in the horse-head cape, spoke for a moment, then nd indicated they were going.  d Jondalar waved as Jeren and his hunters left. Then they b their packing and, with some reservations, started out to- lorth.    oumeyers traveled across the northern end of the vast central they could see the terrain ahead was changing; the flat low- ; giving way to rugged hills. The occasional highlands that noted the central plain were connected, though partly sub- neath the soil in the midland basin, to great broken blocks sedimentary rock running in an irregular backbone from to southwest through the plain. Relatively recent volcanic had covered the highlands with fertile soils that nurtured Mne, spruce, and larch on the upper reaches, with birch and i the lower slopes, while brush and steppe grass grew on the es.  ' started up into the rugged hills, they found themselves backtrack and work their way around deep holes and broken > that blocked their way.

Looking back from the 1 elevation, they gained a new perspective of the land they d.

They saw mammoths less often, usually traveling north, but from a distance the giant woolly beasts commanded attention W not driven by the demands of reproduction, male mammoths tenil^ to form small herds with loose ties for companionship. Occasion iD one would join a female herd and travel with it for a while, but wh^1 ever the Joumeyers noticed a lone mammoth, it was invariably maU The larger permanent herds were of closely related females; a graniL mother, the old and wily matriarch who was their leader, and some.  times a sister or two, with their daughters and grandchildren. Th> female herds were easy to identify because their tusks tended to be somewhat smaller and less curved, and there were always youne ones with them.  Though also impressive when they were sighted, woolly rhinocer-' oses were most rare and least social. They didn't, as a rule, heni^ together. Females kept to small family groups and, except during max-5 ing, males were solitary. Neither mammoths nor rhinoceroses, except for the young and the very old, had much to fear from four-legged hunters, not even the huge cave lion. The males in particular could afford to be solitary; the females needed the herds to help protect their young.  The smaller woolly musk-oxen, however, who were goatlike creatures, all banded together for protection. When they were under attack, the adults usually packed themselves into a circular phalanx facing outward, with the young ones in the middle. A few chamois and ibex made an appearance as Ayla and Jondalar climbed higher m the hills; they often dropped down to lower ground with the approach of winter.  Many of the small animals were secure for the winter in their nests burrowed deep in the ground, surrounded by stores of seeds, nuts, bulbs, roots, and, in the case of pikas, piles of hay that they had cut and dried. The rabbits and hares were changing color, not to white, but to a lighter mottled shade, and on a wooded knoll they saw a beaver and a tree squirrel. Jondalar used his spear-thrower to get the beaver.  Besides the meat, the fatty beaver tail was a rare and rich delicacy, roasted by itself on a spit over the fireplace.  They usually used the spear-throwers for the larger game we' hunted. They were both quite accurate with the weapons, butjondal had more power, could throw farther. Ayla often brought down the smaller animals with her sling.  Though they didn't hunt them, they noticed that otter, badge' i narten, and mink were also numerous. The carnivores-- Ives lynxes, and larger cats--found sustenance in small game er herbivores.

All the signs were old, the charcoal in a shallow pit from the fire of some other sitor.

They knew the torch would not last long, and neither of them wanted to go ght of the fading light from the entrance. They walked back lie limestone walls and were glad to see the drab gold of dry brilliant golden light outlining clouds in the west.  As they rode deeper into the highlands north of the great plain, Ayla and Jondalar noticed more changes. The terrain }v ?^1 coming pocked with caves, caverns, and sinkholes that ranged f?  bowl-shaped dips covered with grass, to inaccessible drop-offs th rcS to great depths. It was a peculiar landscape that made them fj vaguely uneasy. While surface streams and lakes were rare, they so times heard the eerie sound of rivers running underground.  Unknown creatures of warm ancient seas were the cause of tha» strange and unpredictable land. Over untold millennia, the sea floor grew thick with their settling shells and skeletons. After even lonwr eons, the sediment of calcium hardened, was lifted high by conflicriinr movements of the earth, and became rocks of calcium carbonate lime.  stone. Underlying great stretches of land, most of the earth's cavea were formed out of limestone because, given the right conditions the hard sedimentary rock will dissolve.  In pure water, it is hardly soluble at all, but water that is even slightly acid attacks limestone. During warmer seasons and when climates were humid, circulating ground water, bearing carbonic add from plants and charged with carbon dioxide, dissolved vast quantities of the carbonate rock.  Flowing along flat bedding planes and down minute cracks at the vertical joints in the thick layers of the calcareous stone, the ground water gradually widened and deepened the fissures. It carved jagged pavements and intricate grooves as it carried the dissolved limestone away, to escape in seepages and springs. Forced to lower levels by gravity, the acidic water enlarged underground cracks into caves. ] Caves became caverns and stream channels, with narrow vertical shafts I opening into them, and eventually joined with others to become entire subterranean water systems.  The dissolving rock below the ground had a profound effect on the j land above it, and the landscape, called karst, displayed unusual and distinctive features. As caves became larger, and their tops extended closer to the surface, they collapsed, creating steep-walled sinkholes. j Occasional remnants of the cavern roofs left natural bridges. Streams ^ and rivers running along the surface would suddenly disappear in ^ the sinkholes and flow underground, sometimes leaving valleys tna had been formed earlier by rivers, high and dry. ' Water was becoming harder to find. Running water quickly s j into cavities and potholes in the rocks. Even after a heavy rainfall, j water disappeared almost instantly, with no rivulets or streams j ning across the ground.

[heir uneasiness made Ayla and Jondalar very careful trav- gh the karst landscape, with its strange formations, caves, but familiarity lessened their concern. They were walking horses a rest. Jondalar had Racer on a long lead but let him ze a mouthful of the sparse dry grass now and then.

You don't know any more about it than I do." Ayla wasn't quite sure why it her so much, except that she had counted on him to know wk11 expect, and now she found that he didn't. It made her feel n about the strange place. 01 They had been walking along, involved in the conversation thar j edging toward a grievance, if not an argument, and not payino muj.  attention to where they were going. Suddenly Wolf, who had ho— trotting alongside of Ayla, yipped and nudged her leg. They hfA turned to look and stopped short.

Jondalar wondered whether they should try to follow d ® the water or keep to the highland above, but he was glad they ' following the river's course and not attempting to cross it. Rather^ valleys with grassy slopes and broad floodplains, in karst region large rivers that could be seen from the surface tended to flow in w sided limestone gorges. As difficult as it was to use waterways as tra routes with no stream edge to walk along, it was even harder to across them.  Remembering the great gorge farther south, with long stretchetJ where there were no banks, Jondalar decided to stay on the highland ^ As they continued to climb, he was relieved to see a long thin stream of water falling down the face of the rock into the water of the rim below. Although the waterfall was across the river, it meant some water was available on the higher ground, even though most of jt quickly disappeared into the cracks of the karst.  But karst was also a landscape with many caves. They were m frequent that Ayla and Jondalar, and the horses, spent the next tw» nights protected from the weather by stone walls, without having to put up the tent. After examining several, they began to develop a seme; about which openings in the rock were likely to be suitable for them. 'S Although water-filled caverns deep underground were continuing to increase in size, most enterable caves near the surface were no longer growing larger. Instead, the space inside was decreasing, sometimes rapidly when the general conditions were wet, though hardly changin|l at all during dry spells. Some caves could only be entered in diy weather; they would fill up during heavy rains. Some, though always open, had running streams covering the floors. The travelers looked for dry caves, usually somewhat higher up, but water, along with limestone, had been the instrument that had shaped and sculpted all w j them. j Rainwater, slowly seeping through the rock of the roof, absorbed j the dissolved limestone. Each drip of calcareous water, even the tiniest ^ droplet of moisture in Ae air, was saturated with calcium carbonate m j solution, which was redeposited inside the cave. Though usually P"" white, the hardened mineral could be beautifully translucent, or mottled and shaded with gray, or faintly colored with tints of red yellow. Pavements of travertine were created, and immovable drap" eries festooned the walls. Icicles of stone hanging from the ce i"b strained with each wet drop to meet their counterparts growing slow/ from Ae floor. Some were joined in Ain-waisted columns, which y" j thicker with time in the ever-changing cycle of the living earth.  hrere setting noticeably colder and windier, and Ayla and k clad for the prevalence of caves to break the chill of the hciially checked potential shelters to make sure they were khv four-legged inhabitants before they moved in, but ihev could rely on the keener senses of their traveling to warn them of danger.

When she returned, Jondalar had alrf^?  started the fire, and she asked him to go to the stream and fill unrf7 waterbags.  Wolf arrived before the man came back, but when the animal an.  proached the cave, he bared his teeth and snarled menacingly. Avfa felt the hairs on the back of her neck rise.  "Wolf, what is it?" she said, unconsciously reaching for her slin» and picking up a stone, although her spear-thrower was just as close.  The wolf stalked slowly into the cave, his throat rumbling with a deeo snarl. Ayla followed behind, ducking her head to enter the small dark opening in the rock, and she wished she had brought a torch. But her nose told her what her eyes could not see. It had been many years since she had smelled that odor, but she would never forget it. Suddenly her mind pictured that first time so long ago. r They were in the foothills of the mountains not far from the Claa Gathering. Her son was riding on her hip, supported by his carrying cloak, and though she was young and one of the Others, she wa» walking in the medicine woman's position. They had all stopped in their tracks and were staring at the monstrous cave bear, nonchalantly scratching his back against the bark of the tree. ' Though the huge creature, twice the size of ordinary brown bears, was the most revered totem of all the Clan, the young people of Bruns clan had never seen a living one. There were none left in the mountains near their cave, though dry bones attested to the fact that that once had been. For the powerful magic they contained, Creb had re the few tufts of hair that had been caught in the bark after the cave bear finally lumbered off, leaving only his distinctive smell behind.    Ayla signaled Wolf and backed out of the cave. She noticed the sbttf in her hand and tucked it in her waist tie with a wry face. What goo" was a sling against a cave bear?

We have time before it gets dark to place." ading the night in their tent out in the open, they started the morning, wanting to put still more distance between md the cave bear. Jondalar didn't want to take the time to it, and he convinced Ayla that the temperature was cold it to keep. He was in a hurry to get out of the region Where there was one bear, there were usually more.  i they reached the top of a ridge, they stopped. In the cold air, they could see in all directions, and the view was Directly east, a snow-covered mountain of somewhat ion rose in the foreground, drawing attention to the eastern r now and curving around them.

The huge range of much higher mountains to the west^ lost in clouds. '.' The distant mountains that surrounded them were magnificent l.i» the most heart-stopping sight was closer at hand. Down below in rir deep gorge, the course of the Great Mother River had changed dirws.  tion. It was now coming from the west. As Ayla and Jondalar stanS down from the ridge and looked upstream at the wavering course rf the river, they, too, felt as though they had reached a turning point. I "The glacier we have to cross is due west of here," Jondalar said id voice taking on a faraway tone that matched his thoughts, "but W<?HJ follow the Mother and she'll veer a little to the northwest after a whites then southwest again until we reach it.

"Is that the Mother?" Ayla asked. "All of her, I mean, not just channel?" "That's all of her. She's still a good-size river, but nothing like s was," Jondalar conceded.  "We've been beside her for quite a while, then. I didn't know th I'm used to seeing the Great Mother River so much more full, wh she isn't all spread out. I thought we were following a channel. We crossed feeders that were greater," Ayla said, feeling a little ols^ pointed that the enormous swollen Mother of rivers had become )U» another large waterway..^ "We're up high. She looks different from here. There is more to h» than you think," he said. "We have some large tributaries to cross, y^ and there will be stretches where she breaks into channels again, ^ she will keep getting smaller." Jondalar stared toward the west u. j lence for a time; then he added, "This is just the beginning ofwv^^ We should make it to the glacier in plenty of time... it no happens to delay us." mevcrs turned west along the high ridge, following the A of the river. The elevation continued to increase on the if the river until they were looking down from a high point little southward lobe.

He had let his pale yellow beard ern owe ; he usually did in winter, to help keep his face warm, and she al ' as did like him with a beard. He liked to call her beautiful but i lZ8 mind, he was beautiful.  "That animal can sure run!" he said. "And did you see that rnamitf icent rack? One of his antlers must be twice as big as I am!" Ayla was smiling, too. "He was magnificent, and beautiful but I' glad we didn't get him. He was too big for us, anyway. We couldn't take all that meat, and it would have been a shame to kill him when we didn't need it." They rode back to the Mother, and even though their clothes had dried on them somewhat, they were glad to make camp and chance They made a point of hanging their damp clothing near the fire so it could dry further.  The next day they started out heading west; then the river veered toward the northwest. Some distance beyond, they could see another high ridge. The high prominence that reached all the way to the Great Mother River was the farthest northwest finger, the last they would see, of the great chain of mountains that had been with them almost from the beginning. The range had been west of them then, and they had traveled around its broad southern end following the lower course of the Great Mother River. The whitened mountain peaks had marched along to the east of them in a great curving arc, as they rode up the central plain beside the river's winding middle course. Going west along the Mother's upper course, the ridge ahead was the last outlier.  No tributaries joined the long river until they were almost up to the ridge, and Ayla and Jondalar realized they must have been between channels again. The river that joined from the east at the foot of the rocky promontory was the other end of the northern channel of tw Mother. From there the river flowed between the ridge and a high hul across the water, but there was enough lowland riverbank to ndc j around the base of the high rocky point.  They crossed another large tributary just on the other side of vac ridge, a river whose great valley marked the separation between ; two groups of mountain ranges.

Jondalar was up, too. There was a commoti outside the tent, horses neighing and hooves stamping. They hea Wolf snarling, then a yelp of pain. They threw back their covers a rushed out of the tent.  It was very dark, with only a sliver of a moon, which shed lit light, but there were more horses in the pine woods than the two th had left there. They could tell from the sounds, though they could see anything. As she ran toward the sounds of horses, Ayla tripped an exposed root and fell heavily to the ground, knocking the wind ( of her.  "Ayla! Are you all right?" Jondalar said, searching for her in dark. He'd only heard her fall.

Both of them realized there were some hard dec"' make.  "If we take just the sleeping rolls and the ground cover whirl be used as a low tent, and roll them up together, that should Racer's back behind us," Jondalar suggested.  "A low tent should be enough," Ayla agreed. "That's all w, took when we went with the hunters of our clan. We used a st prop up the front, and rocks or heavy bones that we found to w( down around the edges." She began to remember the times dn and several women accompanied the men when they went t "The women had to carry everything except the hunting spe; we had to move fast to keep up, so we traveled light." "What else did you take? How light do you think we can Jondalar asked, his curiosity piqued.  "We'll need the fire-making kit and some tools. A chopper wood to bum, and to break up the bones of any animals we migh to butcher. We can bum dried dung and grass, too, but we ; have something to cut the stems. A knife to skin animals, and a one to cut meat," she began. Ayla was remembering not only the that she accompanied the hunters, but the time she traveled alon she left the clan.  "I'll wear my belt with the loops for holding my axe, and my handled knife," Jondalar said. "You should wear yours, too." "A digging stick is always a help, and it can be used to prop tent.

He would for while, but he'd come looking for us if we didn't get back within a daw or so." ' "Maybe we could tie him close to the camp..." "No! He would hate that, Jondalar!" Ayla exclaimed. "You wouldn't like to be made to stay someplace that you didn't want to be! Besides if wolves or something did come, they could attack him and he wouldn't be able to fight, or run out of their way. We'll just have to think of some other way to protect our things." They walked back to their camp in silence, Jondalar a little cha grined and Ayla worried, but both of them still trying to resolve the problem of what to do with their gear while they were gone. As they s approached the tent, Ayla remembered something. } "I have an idea," she said. "Maybe we could put everything in the ; tent and close it up. I still have some of that wolf repellent I made to keep Wolf from chewing on things. I could soften it up and spread it on the tent. That might keep some animals away." "It might, for a while at least, until the rains washed it away, and that could take some time, but it wouldn't keep out the ones that tried to dig or burrow under it." Jondalar paused. "Why couldn't we gather everything together and wrap it up with a tent? Then you could put your repellent on it... but we shouldn't just leave it out." "No, I think we have to get it up, off the ground, like we do with the meat," Ayla said, then more excited, "Maybe we could put it up ^ on the poles. And cover it with the bowl boat, to keep the rain away.  "That's a good idea!" Jondalar said, then paused again. "But those poles could be knocked over by a cave lion, or even a determined pa" of wolves or hyenas." He looked around trying to think, and he noticed a large clump of brambles with long leafless canes full of sharp thorns spreading out from the middle. "Ayla," he said, "do you think w6 could poke the three poles through the middle of those brambles, o them together about halfway up, put our tent bundle on top of ttia» and cover it all with the bowl boat?" „ Ayla's smiled broadened as he talked. "I think we could caretuuyi ' those canes so we could get close enough to get the poles and put everything on top, then weave them back in with Small animals would still be able to get to it, but most of eepine, or staying in their nests, and those sharp thorns ably keep the bigger animals away. Even lions will avoid s. Tondalar, I think it would work!" the few items they could take required thought and consid- sy decided to take a little extra flint and a few essential tools with, some extra rope and cordage, and as much food as rack. In sorting through her things, Ay la located the special ; mammoth-tusk dagger that Talut had given to her at the dien she was adopted by the Lion Camp. The belt had thin igs threaded through it that could be pulled out into loops • things, in particular the dagger, although the carrying belt e used to hold many other useful objects close at hand.  he belt around her hips, over her outer fur tunic, then took »ut and turned it over in her hands, wondering if she should •ugh its point was very sharp, it was more ceremonial than lamut had used one like it to cut her arm, and then, with e had drawn, to mark the ivory plaque that he had worn .leek, counting her among the Mamutoi.  also watched a similar dagger used to make tattoos, by lines in the skin with the point.

The stone small axe was also wrapped in leather to protect it.  led that there was no reason the belt couldn't hold her w. Then she tucked her sling through it, and she finally pouch that held stones for her sling. She felt weighted it was a convenient way to carry things when they had to yery little. She added her spears to the ones Jondalar had •n the carrier of the backpack.  •nger than they had thought to decide what to take, and even more time to safely stow everything they were leaving Ay la felt anxious over the delay, but by noon they were mounted and leaving.  When they started out, Wolf loped along beside them but \ ^l lagged behind, obviously in some pain. Ayla worried about him800^ sure how far or how fast he could travel, but she decided she w "S S have to let him follow at his own pace, and if he couldn't keen r would have to catch up when they stopped. She was torn by '' for both animals, but Wolf was nearby and, though injured she fi4» confident that he would recover. Whinney could be anywhere and ttr longer they delayed, the farther away she might be.    They followed the trail of the herd more or less northeast for some distance; then the tracks of the horses inexplicably changed direction.  Ayla and Jondalar overshot the turn and thought for a moment that' they had lost the trail. They turned back, but it was late afternoon by; the time they found it again, going east, and it was near nightfall when they came to a river. ^ It was evident that the horses had crossed, but it was getting too dark to see the hoofprints and they decided to camp beside the river. ^ The question was, which side? If they crossed now, their wet clothes would probably dry before morning, but Ayla was afraid Wolf would not be able to find them if they crossed the water before he caught up with them. They decided to wait for him and set up their camp where they were.  With their minimal gear, the camp felt bare and depressing. They hadn't seen any more than tracks the whole day. Ayla was beginning to worry that they might be following the wrong herd, and she was worried about Wolf. Jondalar tried to ease her anxieties, but when Wolf hadn't appeared by the time the night sky was filled with stars, her concern for him grew. She waited up quite late, but when Jondalar finally convinced her to join him in their sleeping furs, she still couldnt go to sleep, though she was tired. She had almost dozed off when she felt a cold wet nose nuzzle her.  "Wolf! You made it! You're here! Jondalar, look! Wolf is here," Ayla cried, feeling him wince under her hugs. Jondalar felt relieved and glad to see him, too, though he told himself his happiness was mostly Vs Ayla's sake. At least she might get some sleep. But first she got up give the animal the share she had saved for him of their meal, a ste made of dried meat, roots, and a cake of traveling food.  Earlier, she had mixed dried willowbark tea into a bowl of waters.., had put aside for him, and he was thirsty enough to lap it up, pail""" s ition and all. He curled up beside their sleeping roll and Beep with one arm around him, while Jondalar cuddled close t arm around her. In the freezing cold but clear night, they or clothes, except for their boots and fur outer garments, idn't bother with setting up the low tent.  mght Wolf seemed better in the morning, but she took more l out of her otter-skin medicine bag and added a cup of the » his food. They all had to face crossing the cold river, and sure how it would affect the animal's injury. It might chill uch, but on the other hand, the cold water might actually healing wound, and the internal bruising.  young woman wasn't any too eager to get her clothing wet.  tie dousing of cold water so much--she had often bathed in er--it was the idea of wearing wet trousers and footwear in eezing air.

He was still on the bank padi' back and forth, avoiding the initial plunge, as he often did. Ayla wh'^ tied to encourage him on, and she saw him finally jump in.  They reached the opposite shore without incident, except for feeliir cold. The chill wind blowing on their wet legs when they dismounted didn't help. After pushing most of the water off with their hands they hurried to put on their pants and moccasin-boots, with liners ofdowirol chamois wool felted together—a departing gift from the Sharamudoi. I for which they were more than grateful at that moment. Their legs and' feet tingled with the returning warmth. When Wolf reached the shore,; he climbed on the bank and shook himself. Ayla checked him over to!  satisfy herself that he was none the worse for the cold swim. ; They located the trail easily and remounted the young stallion. Wotf again tried to keep up, but he soon lagged behind. Ayla worriedly' watched him falling farther and farther back. That he had found them' the night before eased her fears a little, and she consoled herself with the knowledge that he had often run off hunting or exploring on his own and had always caught up with them again. She hated to leave him behind, but they had to find Whinney.  It was midaftemoon before they finally caught sight of horses in the distance. As they drew nearer, Ayla strained to find her friend amidst the others. She thought she caught a glimpse of a familiar hay-colored coat, but she couldn't be sure. There were too many other horses with coats that were similar, and when the wind carried their scent to the herd, they raced away.  "Those horses have been hunted before," Jondalar remarked. But be was glad that he caught himself in time before he voiced his next thought out loud: There must be people in this region who like horse- meat. He didn't want to upset Ayla even more. The herd soon outdis tanced a young stallion that was carrying two passengers, but 0167 continued to follow the trail. It was all they could do for now.  The herd turned south, for some reason only they knew, heawfv back toward the Great Mother River. Before long, the ground beg^ to slope up. The land became rugged and rocky, and the grass id sparse. They continued until they came to a broad field high aDove^ rest of the landscape.

Then he slipped off the backpack. "Pin going to take this off and leave it for now. It limits my movement." He took his own thrower and spears out of the holder. "Once you net Whinney, you can get Racer and come back for me." The highland angled in a northeast-to-southwest direction, with Is gradual incline on the north that became somewhat steeper toward thr east. At the southwestern end, it jutted up like a precipice. On die western side, facing the river they had crossed earlier, it fell off sharply enough, but toward the south and the Great Mother River there was • high precipice with a sheer drop. As Ayla and Jondalar walked back toward the horses, the day was clear, and the sun was high in the sly,; though well past its zenith. They looked over the steep western edge, | then shied back from it, afraid that a misstep or a stumble might carry; them down.  When they got closer to the grazing herd, they stopped and tried t»j find Whinney. The herd—mares, foals, and yearlings—was grazing a | the middle of a field of waist-high dry grass; the herd stallion was off to one side, somewhat away from the others. Ayla thought she saw her horse far back, toward the south. She whistled, the dun-yellow mare's head came up, and Whinney started toward them. With his spear- thrower in hand and a spear in place ready to go, Jondalar slowly edged toward the cream-colored stallion, attempting to get between him and the herd, while Ayla walked toward the mares, determined to reach ^ Whinney.  While she was working her way toward the mare, some of the wrses stopped grazing and looked up, but they weren't looking at her. a had a sudden feeling that something was not right. She turned aro to look for Jondalar, and she saw a wisp of smoke, and then another- was the smell of smoke she had noticed. The field of dry grass ablaze in several places.

Though her coat was the ie choking air, Ayla knew it was Whinney. She whistled courage her, and she saw her beloved mare stop, undecided.  ct to run with the herd was strong in her, but that whistle s meant safety, security, love, and she was not as frightened She had been raised with the smell of smoke nearby.

Whinney started tn^ follow, and Racer rushed to overtake her. As the herd raced closer and closer to the edge of the cliff and the sure death waiting below the mare with a coat the color of sun-ripened hay and the young brown stallion she had foaled, with the woman on his back, were being carried along with them! With fierce determination, Ayla pulled Racer to a stop in front of his dam. He whinnied with fear, wanting to run in panic with the rest of the horses, but he was held in check by Ac?  woman and the commands he was trained to obey..; Then all the horses had passed her by. As Whinney and Racer stood shivering with fear, the last of the herd disappeared over the edge of the cliff. Ayla shuddered at the distant sound of neighing, screaming, I whinnying horses, and then she was stunned by the silence. Whinney' and Racer and she, herself, could have been with them. She breathed deeply at the close call, then looked around for Jondalar.  She didn't see him. The fire was moving south but east; the wind was blowing away from the southwestern edge of the field--but die flames had served their purpose. She looked in all directions, but Jondalar was nowhere in sight. Ayla and the two horses were alone on the smoking field. She felt a lump of fear and anxiety rise in her throat.  What happened to Jondalar?  She slid off Racer and, still holding his lead rope, leaped easily onto Whinney's back, then headed back to the place where they had separated.  She scanned the area carefully, walking back and forth, looking for tracks, but the ground was covered with hoofprints. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she spied something and ran to see what it was.  With her heart pounding in her throat, she picked up Jondalar's spear- thrower!  Looking more closely, she saw footprints, obviously many P^".  but distinctive among them were the imprints of Jondalar's large t encased in his well-worn boots. She had seen those prints too many times at their campsites to be mistaken. Then she saw a dark spot o the ground. She reached down to touch it and pulled back a fingertip red with blood. .s opened wide, and fear caught in her throat.

It wasn't so much that she was hungry, but she had to keep her strength up if she was going to follow td find Jondalar.  icr nagging worry that had been bothering her besides the ui, was the missing wolf. She couldn't leave to find Jondalar ound Wolf. He was more than just an animal companion ved, he could be essential in following the trail. She hoped tppear before nightfall, and she wondered if she could back- their trail until she found him. But what if he was hunting?  miss him. As impatient as it made her feel, she decided it ) wait.  d to think about what she could do, but she couldn't even  think of possible courses of action. The very act of hurtine and taking him away was so alien to her that it was hard beyond it. It seemed such an unreasonable, illogical thing to» Intruding on her thoughts she heard a whine and then a turned to see Wolf running toward her, obviously happy to sep k'^ She was greatly relieved. ^1 "Wolf!" she cried with joy. "You made it, and much earlier ri»«- yesterday. Are you better?" After greeting him affectionately she«-» amined him and was glad when she confirmed again that although W was definitely bruised, nothing was broken, and he seemed much im.  proved.  She decided to leave immediately, so she could pick up the trail while it was still light. She tied Racer's lead to a strap that held Whu^i ney's riding blanket on, then mounted the mare. Calling Wolf to follow her, she started back toward the trail, then rode all the way to the place' where she had found his footprints along with the others, his spear.  thrower, and the spot of blood, now a slightly brownish stain on Ac ground. She dismounted to examine the place again. ,} "We have to find Jondalar, Wolf," she said. The animal looked at her quizzically, s She lowered herself and, sitting comfortably on her haunches, looked more closely at the footprints, making an effort to identify individuals so she could estimate how many there were, and to commit the size and shapes of them to memory. The wolf waited, sitting on his haunches and staring at her, sensing something unusual and impor tant. Finally she pointed to the bloodstain.  "Someone hurt Jondalar and carried him away. We need to find him." The wolf sniffed the blood, then wagged his tail and yipped.  "That's Jondalar's footprint," she said, pointing to the distinctive large impression among the smaller ones. Wolf again sniffed where she pointed, then looked at her, as if waiting for her next move. "They took him away," she said, indicating the other imprints of human feet.  Suddenly she stood up and walked over to Racer. She took Jond^ lar's spear-thrower out of the pack on Racer's back and knelt to let the wolf sniff it. "We have to find Jondalar, Wolf! Someone took bun away, and we're going to get him back!" it slowly became aware that he was awake, but caution lie still until he could sort out what was wrong, because nost certainly was.

That was the last thing he remembered, except for a fleetiiw.  recollection of a sharp pain before everything went dark. ^^ Someone must have hit me with something, Jondalar thought It was a hard blow, too, because I don't remember anything about beir brought here, and my head still hurts. Did they think I was spoiling their hunting strategy? The first time he'd met Jeren and his hunters.  it had been under similar circumstances. He and Thonolan had inad vertently run off a herd of horses the hunters had been driving towarf a trap. But Jeren had understood, once he got over his anger, that it wasn't intentional, and they had become friends. I didn't spoil the hunt of these people, did I?  He tried again to sit up. Bracing himself on his side, he pulled htt knees up, then strained to roll and bob up into a sitting position, fc took a few tries and left his head throbbing from the effort, but he!  finally succeeded. He sat with his eyes closed, hoping the pain would soon subside. But as it eased off, his concern for Ayla and the animals grew. Had Whinney and Racer been swept over the edge with the herd, and had Racer taken Ayla with him?  Was she dead? He felt his heart beat with fear just thinking about it Were they all gone, Ayla and the horses? What about Wolf? When the injured animal finally reached the field, he would find no one. Jondalar imagined him sniffing around, trying to follow a trail that went no' where. What would he do? Wolf was a good hunter, but he was hurt.  How well could he hunt for himself with his injury? He would nusij Ayla and the rest of his "pack." He wasn't used to living alone. HoWj would he get along? What would happen when he came up against ^ pack of wild wolves? Would he be able to defend himself? | Isn't anyone going to come? I'd like a drink of water, J011"3",!  thought. They must have heard me. I'm hungry, too, but n108"^ thirsty. His mouth felt drier and drier, and his craving for water gK j stronger. "Hey, out there! I'm thirsty! Can't someone bring a inao j drink of water?" he shouted. "What kind of people are you?

It was cold, but'n l< offered him his fur parka or even untied his hands so he could 01 them together.  But the cool air revived him, and he noticed that some of the men had their hands tied behind their backs, too. He looked closely at the people among whom he had been thrust. They wei.2 ages, from young men—more like boys actually—to oldsters. All.2l them looked thin, weak, and dirty, with tattered, inadequate cloriw^ and matted hair. A few had untended wounds, full of dried blood and dirt. ^i Jondalar tried to speak to the man standing next to him in Mamutf-i but he just shook his head. Jondalar thought he didn't understand as he tried Sharamudoi. The man looked away just as a woman holdingt: spear came and threatened Jondalar with it, barking a sharp commandl He didn't know her words, but her actions were plain enough, andht wondered if the reason the man had not spoken was that he didn't understand him, or if he had, had not wanted to speak, j Several women with spears spaced themselves around the group of men. One of them shouted some words and the men started walldnB Jondalar used the opportunity to look around and try to get a sense of where he was. The settlement, consisting of several rounded dwdfc-i ings, felt vaguely familiar, which was strange because the countrysid| was totally unknown to him. Then he realized it was the dwellings.  They resembled Mamutoi earthlodges. Though they were not exactly the same, they appeared to be constructed in a similar fashion, probes biy using the bones of mammoths as structural supports that wct< covered with thatch, then sod and clay. 5 They started walking uphill, which afforded Jondalar a broadtf view. The countryside was mostly grassy steppeland or tundra—tree less plains on land with frozen subsoil that thawed to a black inucly surface in summer. Tundra was able to support only dwarfed aetvs, but in spring their conspicuous blossoms added color and beauty, aw they fed musk-oxen, reindeer, and other animals that could dige» them. There were also stretches of taiga, low-growing evergreen treo so uniform in height that their tops could have been sheared on By some gigantic cutting tool, and in fact they were. Icy winds unv^ needles of sleet or sharp bits of gritty loess cut short any indivi twig or tip that dared to strive above its brethren. -^.  As they trudged higher, Jondalar saw a herd of mammoths y9"' far to the north, and somewhat closer, reindeer. He knew ^ roamed nearby—the people had been hunting them—and he gu that bison and bear frequented the region in the warmer seasons. iled his own country more than it did the dry grassy steppes at least in the types of plants that grew, although the eeetation was different, and probably the proportional mix too.  ie corner of his eye, Jondalar caught movement to the left.  n time to see a white hare dash across the hill chased by an }s he watched, the large rabbit suddenly bounded in an- ion, passing by the partially decomposed skull of a woolly then scooted into its hole.  tere are mammoths and rhinoceroses, Jondalar thought, ive lions, and with the other herding animals, probably [ certainly wolves.

Not only could be seen from a distance, the vast and various herds that land had to pass through a narrow corridor below that lay ;ep walls of limestone and a river. They would be easy to here. It made him wonder why they had been hunting the Great Mother River.  g wail brought Jondalar's attention back to his immediate fs. A woman with long, stringy, disheveled gray hair was )rted by two somewhat younger women as she wailed and dous grief. Suddenly she broke free, fell on her knees, and elf over something on the ground. Jondalar edged forward ser look.

The gray-haired woman was lifted, almost dragged-thouoh ^ roughly—away from the body of the young man by the two won1'!  who had tried to support her. Then another woman stepped forwmSI and something about her made Jondalar look again. Her face ^^ strangely skewed, oddly unsymmetrical, with one side seeminote pushed back and slightly smaller than the other. She made no attem^ to hide it. Her hair was light-colored, perhaps gray, pulled back ami piled up into a bun on top of her head. ; Jondalar thought she was about his mother's age, and she moved with the same grace and dignity, although there was no physical reseatt blance to Marthona. In spite of her slight deformity, the woman w« not unattractive, and her face commanded attention. When she cauohk his eye, he realized he had been staring, but she looked away fine rather quickly, he thought. As she began to speak, he realized thatsht was conducting the funeral ceremony. She must be a mamut, hi thought, a woman who communicates with the spirit world, a zeiatf donii for these people. 1 Something made him turn and look to the side of the congregation!  Another woman was staring at him. She was tall, quite muscular and strong featured, but a handsome woman with light brown hair and, interestingly, very dark eyes. She did not turn away when he looked!  at her, but appraised him quite frankly. She had the size and shape| the general appearance of a woman that he would ordinarily be att tracted to, he thought, but her smile made him uneasy. ?  Then he noticed she was standing with her legs apart and her hand!  on her hips, and suddenly he knew who she was: the woman who had laughed so menacingly. He fought an urge to move back and hide among the other men, knowing he couldn't even if he tried. He wH not only a head taller, he was far healthier and more muscular w» they. He would be conspicuous no matter where he stood. ^ The ceremony seemed rather perfunctory, as if it were an ""P1^8".  necessity, rather than a solemn, important occasion. With no shrouds, the bodies were simply carried to a single shallow grave at a time.

The grave was hurriedly filled in, with soil that had es of loose charcoal and partially burned wood mixed in.  res must have burned here, Jondalar thought. He glanced narrow corridor below. With dawning insight, it occurred this high ground was a perfect lookout from which fires ed to signal when animals--or anything else--approached.  as the bodies were covered, the men were marched back lill and taken to an area surrounded by a high palisade of se trunks placed side by side and lashed together.

He was separated from uid taken back to the earthlodge, then shoved toward the liar, hide-covered enclosure again.

"It's about time someone came! Let me out of here! Let me out here now!" he shouted.  He heard the rustlings of someone unlashing the gate.

She was opposite the fenced: and, as he walked past it, Jondalar sensed again that he was b watched through the cracks.  As he drew near, he was sure the fur on her seat was from a wonCj The hood of her parka, thrown back off her head, was trimmed wiA| wolf fur, and around her neck she wore a necklace made primarily o1 the sharp canine teeth of wolves, although there were some from arctic fox, and at least one cave-bear tooth.

She was on the I of one of those horses, and I couldn't let them carry her alone " "Ayla?" "Didn't you see her? She is the woman I have been traveling wit Attaroa laughed. "You were traveling with a woman who ridd the backs of horses? If you are not a traveling storyteller, you 1 missed your calling." Then she leaned forward and, jabbing herfu at him for emphasis, said, "Everything you've said is untrue. You a liar and a thief!" "I am neither a liar nor a thief! I have told the truth and I have st nothing," Jondalar said with conviction. But in his heart he coul really blame her for not believing him. Unless someone had seen A who would believe that they had traveled by riding on the back horses? He began to worry about how he would ever convince Att that he wasn't lying, that he had not intentionally interfered with t hunt. If he'd known the full extent of his plight, he would have t more than concerned.  Attaroa studied the tall, muscular, handsome man standing in t of her, wrapped in the hides he had torn from his cage. She not that his blond beard was a shade darker than his hair and that his e an unbelievably vivid shade of blue, were compelling. She felt stroi attracted to him, but the very strength of her response dredged painful memories long suppressed and provoked a powerful strangely twisted reaction.

A low, narrow entrance led through a ^eway to another' low opening. Jondalar had to bend over »ent-kneed for a few paces, then step down three stairs. No t a child, could enter her dwelling easily, but once inside, OS able to stand to his full height with room to spare. The tt who had followed stayed outside.  8 eyes adjusted to the dim interior, he noticed a bed platform ; far wall. It was covered with a white fur of some kind.  d unusual white animals were held sacred among his people d discovered in his travels, by many others as well.

But this was not a 1" inviting area for activities and visitors. It had a closed and secretive feeling. Jondalar felt sure that S'Armuna lived alone a other people seldom entered her domain.  He watched her stir up the fire, add dried dung and a few wi l- 4 wood, and pour water into a blackened, pouchlike container fomn8^" the stomach of an animal, attached to a frame of bone. From a hadS on one of her shelves, she added a small handful of some dried mai-p'?  and when the water began to soak through the container, she mov»?3 directly over the flames. As long as there was liquid in it, even if it boiling, the pouch could not catch fire.  Though Jondalar did not know what it was, the odor that rose fit- the pot was familiar and, strangely, made him think of home. With sudden flash of memory, he knew why. It was a smell that had oft» emanated from a zeiandoni's fire. They used the decoction to waA wounds and injuries.  "You speak the language very well. Did you live among the Zeiao.  donii long?" Jondalar asked, i S'Armuna looked up at him and seemed to consider her reply. "Several years," she said. ; "Then you know that the Zeiandonii welcome their visitors. I don^t understand these people. What could I possibly have done to deserve such treatment?" Jondalar said. "You shared the hospitality of the Zeiandonii--why don't you explain to them about rights of passage and courtesy to visitors? It's really more than a courtesy, it's an obligation." S'Armuna's only response was a sardonic glance. "' He knew he wasn't handling the situation well, but he was still SB incredulous over his recent experiences that he found himself with at almost childish need to explain how things should be, as if that woulB put them right. He decided to try another approach.  "I wonder, since you lived there so long, if you knew my mother. I am the son of Marthona..." He would have continued, but the expression on her somewhat misshapen face stopped him. She registered such shock that it contorted her features even more. ^.

She had awakened that morning with a strong sense of forebodinn and she was glad to see that Wolf seemed eager to start out butS afternoon she could tell he was tiring. She decided to stop and make.  cup of tea to let him rest and give the horses time to graze.  Not long after starting out again she came to a fork in the river. Shi had easily crossed a couple of small streams flowing down from thjr highlands, but she wasn't sure if she should cross the river. She hadnit1 seen tracks for some time, and she didn't know whether to take the east fork or make the crossing and follow the west one. She kept to the east for a while, weaving back and forth, trying to find the trail, and just: before nightfall she saw an unusual sight that clearly showed her the way to go. ; Even in the failing light, she knew the posts sticking out of the water had been put there for a purpose. They had been pounded into Ac riverbed near several logs that were lodged into the bank. From the time she spent with the Sharamudoi, she recognized the construction; as a rather simple docking place for some kind of watercraft. Aytt' started to make her camp beside it, then changed her mind. She didn't know anything about the people she was following, except that they had hurt Jondalar and then taken him with them. She did not wart such people to come upon her unawares, while she was sleeping and vulnerable. She chose a place around a bend in the river instead.  In the morning she carefully examined the wolf before entering the river. Though not especially wide, the water was cold and deep, a"" he would have to swim it. His bruises were still tender to the touA but he was very much improved, and he was eager to go. He see to want to find Jondalar as much as she did.

She sure the women would be returning soon, but "soon" could be day, or the next, or the one after. She wanted to find Jondalar as i as possible, but she didn't want to continue following the trail and 1 them catch up with her. She was also reluctant to approach t!  directly until she knew more about them. She finally decided to for a place to wait for them where she could watch them cob without being seen.  She was pleased that her wait was not too long. By afternoon: saw the two women returning, along with several other people, carrying litters of butchered meat and sections of horse. They w moving surprisingly fast in spite of their loads. When they dr nearer, Ayla realized there was not a single man in the hunting pan All the hunters were women! She watched them load the meat on I raft, then pole across using the rope for a guide. They hid the raft a' unloading it, but they left the guide rope strung across the river, wt puzzled her.  Ayla was again surprised at how fast they traveled as they sta up the trail. Almost before she knew it, they were gone. She wa some time before she followed, and she kept well behind.    Jondalar was appalled at the conditions inside the fence. The onl^ shelter was a rather large, crude lean-to, which offered scant protection from rain or snow, and the fence of posts, itself, which blocked W; wind. There were no fires, little water, and no food ava^a^e'-lj only people within the Holding were male, and they showed the en j of the poor conditions.

It was S'Amodun who spoke. He had left the lean-to and just joined the group.  "It's hard to imagine anything worse," Jondalar said.

"She was hunting and killed its dam, and then she saw the foal." j "But why would she raise it?" Ebulan asked.

When Whinney grew up--Ayla named the horse Whinney--she gave birth to a colt, just about the time we met. She showed me how to ride and gave me the colt to train. I named him Racer.

"I'm sure you've heard many things about me already, but you should lieve everything you hear." "I believe what I see,"Jondalar said.  "Well, you saw me bring food in here."

"I hold you responsible," Jondalar said to S'Armuna's retreatiir back. ° As soon as the gate closed, one of the guard women said, "You'd better come and get it, before she changes her mind." ,.  The men rushed for the platters of meat on the ground. As S'AmoK dun passed by, he stopped. "Be very careful, Zeiandonii. She htf something special in mind for you." The next few days passed slowly for Jondalar. Some water, but little additional food was brought in, and no one was allowed out, not eveal to work, which was very unusual. It made the men uneasy, especially8 since Ardemun was also kept inside the Holding. His knowledge of several languages had made Ardemun first a translator and then a' spokesman between Attaroa and the men. Because of his lame, disk)-8 cated leg, she felt he posed no threat and, further, would not be abhl to run away. He was given more freedom to move around the Campx.  and he often brought back bits of information about the life outside the; Men's Camp and occasionally extra food. ' Most of the men passed the time playing games and gambling W future promises, using as playing pieces small sticks of wood, pebbles,, and even some broken pieces of bone from meat they had been g^®."

He huddled together faers for warmth, sharing his makeshift cloak with those en less to cover them.  ys that followed, his sensitivity to the odor dulled, and he ced his hunger, but he did seem to feel the cold more and nd light-headed occasionally. He wished for some willow- headache, too.  imstances began to change when the man with the wound . Ardemun went to the gate and asked to speak to Attaroa so the body could be removed and buried. Several men it for the purpose, and later they were told that all who d attend the burial rites. Jondalar was almost ashamed by lent he felt at the thought of getting out of the Holding, ason for the temporary release was a death.  long shadows of a late afternoon sun spread across the blighting features of the distant valley and river below, and t an almost overwhelming sense of the beauty and grandeur landscape. His appreciation was interrupted by a prick of arm. He looked down with annoyance at Epadoa and three en surrounding him with spears, and it took a large measure rol to prevent himself from pushing them out of his way.  its you to put your hands behind your back so they can tie emun said. "You can't go if your hands are not tied." scowled, but he complied. As he followed Ardemun, he >ut his predicament. He wasn't even sure where he was, or i had been here, but the thought of spending any more time in that Holding, with nothing but the fence to look at, was ie could bear.

They walked some distance, crossing a stream and gettine w along the way. The perfunctory funeral was over quickly and T wondered why Attaroa bothered with a burial ceremony at all"0?11^ she showed no concern for the man while he was alive. If she h <^leBtl might not have died. He had not known the man, he didn't even In'0!  his name, he had only seen him in his suffering--unnecessary a&?1 ing. Now he was gone, walking in the next world, but freef^ Attaroa. Perhaps that was better than spending years looking anr inside of a fence.  As short as the ceremony was, Jondalar's feet were cold from stanA.a ing in wet footwear. On the way back, he paid more attention to Hr small waterway, trying to find a stepping-stone or a way across tha» would keep his feet dry. But when he looked down, he didn't care- Almost as though it were intended, he saw two stones next to each other at the edge of the stream. One was a small but adequate nodule of flint; the other was a roundish stone that looked at though it would just fit in his hand--the perfect shape for a hammerstone.  "Ardemun," he said to the man in back of him, then spoke in Zeian- donii. "Do you see these two stones?" He indicated them with his foot.  "Can you get them for me? It's very important." "That is flint?" "Yes, and I'm a flint knapper." Suddenly Ardemun appeared to trip, and he fell down heavily. The crippled man had trouble getting up, and a woman with a spear approached.  She spoke sharply to one of the men, who offered his hand to help him up. Epadoa marched back to see what was holding up the men. Ardemun got to his feet just before she arrived, and he stood contritely apologetic while she railed at him.  When they got back, Ardemun and Jondalar went to the end of the Holding, where the stones were, to pass their water. When they returned to the lean-to, Ardemun told the men that the hunters had returned with more meat from the horse kill, but something had hap- , ;n pened while the second group was returning. He didn't know what i | j! was, but it was causing some commotion among the women. Ihey were all talking, but he hadn't been able to overhear anything specific.  That evening, food and water were brought to the men again, not even the servers were allowed to stay and slice the meat.

"If we did know some- could we do about it?" "ieht, Olamun. It doesn't make sense, but I agree with unk the women were told not to speak," S'Amodun said.  his is the time, then," Jondalar said.

But I think I can make a weapon surprise you," Jondalar said.  rr} i he next morning, before Jondalar began further work on dal flint tools, he talked to S'Amodun about the two injured younestera i He had thought about it the night before, and, recalling how Darro had taken to flint knapping even as a young boy, he felt that if theifl 'Ji could be taught a craft, like flint knapping, they could lead indepcik.1 i dent and useful lives even though they were crippled. ,j ) "With Attaroa as headwoman, do you really think they will evtfl j! have the opportunity?" S'Amodun asked. I '^ "She allows Ardemun more freedom; she might feel that the two'l 11 boys will not be a threat, either, and let them out of the Holding more1 iV often.

"In any case, I will encourage themj j||!|!li(lil| to come and watch you." -.1 Jondalar had worked outside the evening before, so the sharp chipt!  that broke off in the process of knapping the flint would not be scat tered around their only shelter. He had picked a spot somewhat behind < the stone pile near the place where they passed their wastes. Because j of the smell, it was the end of the enclosure that the guards tended to j avoid, and was watched the least. | Ijlll The blade-shaped pieces he had quickly detached from the flint case j 11 were at least four times as lone as they were wide with rounded ends,, iNi'i''! 0 • i TTrf. • iji and these were the blanks from which other tools would be made. n» \softline edges were razor sharp as they were cleaved from the flint core, sharp enough to cut through tough leather as if it were congealed fat. ^ blades were so sharp, in fact, that often the edges had to be dulled t;1!] ] the tool could be handled without cutting the user.  S| Inside the lean-to the following morning, the first thing Jondalar < I was to select a place under a crack in the roof, so he would ^ sufficient light to work by. Then he cut off a piece of leather froiD makeshift cloak and spread it out on the ground to catch the imvi if flint debris. With the two lame boys and several others id him, he proceeded to demonstrate how a hard oval stone ieces of bone could be used to make tools of flint, which in )e used to shape and make things out of leather, wood, and K»h they had to be careful not to draw attention to their Itine up occasionally to maintain a normal routine, then k and huddling together for warmth, which also served to ew of their guards, they all watched with fascination.  picked up a blade and examined it critically.

Then, with the long of a broken legbone, he pressure-flaked the rounded end, ; carefully controlled small chips until it was a point.

Applying careful pres- ic knobby, rounded end of the legbone, he broke off only : edge of both lengths, which dulled them only slightly but, tant, strengthened them, so this piece could be used as a liape and smooth a piece of wood or bone. He showed how and passed it around, too.  next blank, he dulled both edges so the tool could be ily. Then, with two carefully placed blows at one end of led a couple of spalls, leaving a sharp, chisellike point. To ; its use, he cut a groove into a piece of bone, then went ove many times, making it deeper and deeper and creating >f curled shavings. He explained how a shaft, or a point, or Mild be cut out with roughly the desired shape, then fin- aping or smoothing.  i demonstration was almost a revelation. None of the boys men had ever seen an expert flint-knapping toolmaker few of the older men had ever seen one so skilled. In the its of twilight the night before, he had managed to cleave Urty usable blanks from the single nodule of flint before the s too small to work. By the next day, most of the men had more of the tools he made from them.  toed to explain the hunting weapon he wanted to show  them. Some of the men seemed to understand him immedi < 1 though they invariably questioned the accuracy and speed he d ^ <B!  for a spear thrown with a spear-thrower. Others couldn't seem t "^^^ the concept of it at all, but it didn't matter, ow^^ Having good serviceable tools in their hands, and working on <i»^«J thing constructive with them, gave the men a sense of purpose A^S doing anything that opposed Attaroa, and the conditions sheh«i forced upon them, lifted the despair of the Men's Camp and fostpn-i the hope that it might be possible, someday, to regain control ofrhrw own destiny.  Epadoa and her guards sensed a change in attitude over the next few days, and she felt sure something was going on. The men seemed to walk with a lighter step, and they smiled too much, but as hard as she looked, she couldn't see anything different. The men had been extremely careful to hide not only the knives and scrapers and chisels Jondalar had made, and the objects they were making, but even the waste products of their efforts. The smallest flint chip or spall, thf1 tiniest curled shaving of wood or bone, was buried inside the lean-ta and covered with a roof plank or a piece of leather. I But the greatest change of all was in the two crippled boys. Jondalw; not only showed the youngsters how the tools were made, he made special tools for them, and then showed them both how to use them.  They stopped hiding in the shadows of the lean-to and began to get acquainted with the other, older boys in the Holding. Both idolized the tall Zeiandonii, Doban in particular, who was old enough to com-j prehend more, though he was reluctant to show it.  For as long as he could remember, living with the disturbed and' irrational Attaroa, Ardoban had always felt helpless, completely at the mercy of circumstances beyond his control. In a tiny corner of hB being, he had always expected something terrible to happen to bun, and after the excruciatingly painful and terrifying trauma of his expo- rience, he was convinced that his life would only get worse. He oftett wished he were dead. But watching someone take two stones tnatne found near a stream and with them, using the skill of his hands ana the knowledge in his mind, offer the hope of changing his world, made a deep impression. Doban was afraid to ask--he still couldnt trusi anyone--but more than anything, he wanted to learn to make tools of stone. ^ The man sensed his interest and wished that he had more nln,^ he could begin to teach him, at least to get him started.

Jondalar thought it was a strange reaction, but Tgot about it and fell asleep thinking about the problem.    had been thinking about Jondalar, too. She was looking o the diversion he would give her through the long winter, Mitrol over him, and seeing him do her bidding, showing that she was more powerful than the tall, handsome man.  ien she was through with him, she had other plans for him.  cen wondering if he was ready to be let out and set to work.  .d told her that she thought something was going on inside ng, and that the stranger was involved, but she hadn't yet 1 what it was.

Morning she told her women that she wanted a work crew, lude the Zeiandonii man. Jondalar was glad just to be getting ; he could see something besides bare earth and desperate men. It was the first rime he had been allowed outside the work, and he had no idea what she planned to have him hoped he would have an opportunity to look for young, straight1" Finding a way to get them into the Holding would be another nrol Later in the day, Attaroa strode out of her earthlodge, accom by two of her women and S'Armuna, and wearing--flauntinp-.  dalar's fur parka. The men had been carrying mammoth bonp had been brought earlier from some other place, and they were them up where Attaroa wanted. They had worked all mornin into the afternoon with nothing to eat and little to drink. Even d he was out of the Holding, he had not been able to look for poi spear shafts, much less think of a way of cutting them dowi bringing them back. He was watched too closely and given no timel rest. He was not only frustrated, he was tired, and hungry thirsty, and angry.  Jondalar put down one end of the legbone that he and Olamun' carrying, then stood up and faced the approaching women. a!  neared, he noticed how tall she was, taller than many men.

Attaroa said, standing with h on her hips, as though to face him down.  "I don't know where she is. I wish I did. I'm afraid she went' the cliff with the horses you were hunting," Jondalar said.  "You lie, Zeiandonii! My hunters saw no woman on the back horse, and no body of a woman was found with the horses.

"Leadership doesn't necessai belong to one who is blessed by the Mother any more than it doa one who is physically strong.

"It doesn't matter what the task is," Jondalar continued. "The lea of the hunt is the one who knows where the animals will be and wt they will be there; he is the one who can track them.

They stood as f back as they dared. It made some of them sick, but if they did n appear, then any man they had spoken up for in the past was the nc one chosen. Some women had tried to run away, and a few had inan.j aged it, but most were caught and brought back. If there were men l»j the Holding they cared about--mates, brothers, sons--as punishment, the women were made to watch them suffer days in the cay without food or water.

Could the spear have < from the woman-horse? she wondered. But how could anyone i spear from that distance? Then she saw that the woman had : spear close at hand.

Then he was stunned when he realized that the words she sn were in S'Armunai! How could Ayla possibly know how to sb S'Armunai? She had never heard it before, had she?

It reinforced her inner conviction that approaching figure was not simply a woman on a horse.  It had been many years since she'd had those feelings.

She was the one who had brougt all back, the memory, the feelings. If the woman was gone—destro —it would all go away and everything would be fine again.

"Well, it seems the Zeiandonii was telling the truth after all," said. "You came just in time. We thought he was trying to steal m and we have barely enough for ourselves.

"Women of the Clan are raised to accept that," Ayla said. "Thei are not allowed to strike each other, but they can hit a womar reprimand her. They are not supposed to beat them, but some i do." S'Armuna nodded with understanding. "So perhaps in the be ning Brugar's mother took it for granted when the man she lived i hit her, but it must have gotten worse.

"And if it was hard on her to grow up with the Clan, it must h been worse for her son, who was not even a full mixture," Ayla sat "If the spirits mixed as expected, he would have been three p human, and only one part flathead," S'Armuna said.  Ayla suddenly thought of her son, Durc. Broud is bound to m his life difficult. What if he turns out like Brugar?

S'Armuna had a sudden inkling about the mysterious young woffl "How do you know so much about flatheads, Ayla?" she asked.  The question caught Ayla by surprise. She wasn't on her gu she would have been with Attaroa, and she wasn't prepared to it. Instead she blurted out the truth.

Attaroa was finally taken in by a man wt mate had died in childbirth, under very suspicious circumstances baby with her. The suspicions were borne out when it was discov.  that he beat Attaroa and took her before she was even a woman no one else wanted responsibility for her. It was something about mother, some question about her background, but it left Attaroa to raised with and warped by his cruelty. Finally the man died, and x people of her Camp arranged for her to be mated to the new leadc this Camp." "Arranged without her consent?" Jondalar asked.  "They 'encouraged' her to agree, and they brought her to a Brugar. As I said, he could be very charming, and I'm sure he fw her attractive." Jondalar nodded agreement. He had noticed that she could h been quite attractive.  "I think she looked forward to the mating," S'Armuna continii "She felt it would be a chance for a new beginning.

As the visitors walked back with S'Armuna toward her dwelli Jondalar recalled a comment she had made earlier that had piqued curiosity. "How did you keep Brugar away from you?" he asked. " said he tried once to beat you like he did the other women; how i you stop him?" The older woman halted and looked hard at the young man, the the woman beside him. Ayla felt the shaman's indecision and sen she was evaluating them, trying to decide how much to tell them.  "He tolerated me because I am a healer--he always referred to as a medicine woman," S'Armuna said, "but more than anything, feared the world of the spirits." Her comments brought a question to Ayla's mind. "Medic women have a unique status in the Clan," she said, "but they are o healers. Mog-urs are the ones who communicate with the spirits.  "The spirits known to the flatheads, perhaps, but Brugar feared power of the Mother. I think he realized that She knew the harm did, and the evil that corrupted his spirit. I think he feared Her re bution. When I showed him that I could draw on Her power, he dit bother me any more," S'Armuna said.  "You can draw on Her power? How?" Jondalar asked.

Even as an infant, the child was never allowed" appear in public without clothes, the way most babies and children are, and they chose a name with neither a male nor a ending. The child was called Omel," the woman explained.  "Did the child never say?" Ayla asked.  "No. Omel kept the secret, too. I think Brugar may have threat - dire consequences to them both if the child's gender was ever vealed," S'Armuna said.  "There must have been some hint, especially as the child grew o The body that was buried appeared to be of adult size," Jondalar!

However, she has a quick mind and is able to learn more than may be intended... but I also knew that." S'Armuna stopped then, stopped just short of admitting to a grievous transgression, making it clear, but allowing them to draw their own conclusions. She waited until she saw Jondalar frown with concern and Ayla nod in acknowledgment.  "In any case, I did help Attaroa establish her power over the men in the beginning--maybe I wanted power over them myself. In truth, I did more than that. I prodded and encouraged her, convinced her that the Great Earth Mother wanted women to lead, and I helped her to convince the women, or most of them. After the way they had been treated by Brugar and the men, it wasn't hard. I gave her something to put the men to sleep, and I told her to put it in their favorite drink--a brew they fermented from birch sap." "The Mamutoi make a similar drink," Jondalar commented, listening with amazement.  "When the men were sleeping, the women tied them up. They were glad to do it. It was almost a game, a way of getting back at the men.  But Brugar never woke up. Attaroa tried to imply that he was ust more susceptible to the sleeping liquid, but I'm sure she put something else in his drink. She said she wanted to kill him, and I believe she did.  She all but admits it now, but, whatever the truth is, I was the one who led her to believe that women would be better off if the men we .l-A gone. I was the one who convinced her that if there were no men, ul spirits of women would have to mix with the spirits of other wornei1 create new life, and only girl children would be born."

"Cruelty mothers cruelty, pain bre pain, abuse fosters abuse."

And now she is threatening to cripple their sons." , "Tell the women the men must be set free, or no more children wM be born," Ayla said, in tones that sent a chill through both Jondalar and S'Armuna. They turned to stare. Jondalar recognized her expres.  sion. It was the distanced, somewhat objective way she looked when her mind was occupied with someone who was sick or injured, although in this case, he saw more than her need to help. He also saw in her a cold, hard anger he had not seen before.  But the older woman saw Ayla as something else, and she interpreted her pronouncement as a prophecy, or a judgment.  After Ayla served the tea, they sat in silence together, each deeply affected. Suddenly Ayla felt a strong need to go outside and breathe the clean, crisp, cold air, and she wanted to check on the animals, but as she quietly observed S'Armuna, she didn't think it was the best time to leave just yet. She knew the older woman had been devastated, and she sensed that she needed something of meaning to cling to.  Jondalar found himself wondering about the men he had left behind in the Holding, and what they were thinking. They no doubt knew be was back but had not been put back in with them. He wished he comd talk to Ebulan and S'Amodun, and reassure Doban, but he needed some reassuring himself. They were on dangerous ground, and Y hadn't done anything yet, except talk. Part of him wanted to get out there as fast as possible, but the larger part of him wanted to help.  they were going to do something, he wished they would do it s He hated just sitting there.. eg.  Finally, out of desperation, he said, "I want to do something those men in the Holding. How can I help?" a 524 J ir you already have," S'Armuna said, feeling a need to plan eey herself.

It was not an easy explain. She equated Ayla's fascination with healing and ttate need to help with her own feelings about being called ie Mother, and she identified with the young woman.  "We will stay as long as we can," Jondalar amended that they still had to cross a glacier that winter. "The question11 are we going to persuade Attaroa to let the men out?"

I was living alone, and she was nnr only friend. Whinney does what I want because she wants to becauZ we are friends," she said, trying to explain. | The way she said the name was the gentle nicker that was the sound made by a horse. Traveling alone with only Jondalar and the aninuk for so long, she had slipped back into the habit of saying Whinocy^ name in its original form. The nicker coming from the woman's mouth startled S'Armuna, and the very idea of being the friend of a horse ww beyond comprehension. It didn't matter that Ayla had said it wasnY magic. She had just convinced S'Armuna that it was. j "Perhaps," the woman said. But she thought. No matter how simple you try to make it, you can't stop people from wondering who yoK really are, and why you have come here. "People want to think, and hope, that you have come to help them," she continued. "They fat Attaroa, but I think with your help, and Jondalar's, they may b| willing to stand up to her and make her free the men. They may refill to let her intimidate them any more." Ayla was again feeling a strong need to get out of the lodge, whidt was more uncomfortable. "All this tea," she said, standing up. "I nee% to pass water. Can you tell me where to go, S'Armuna?" After she listened to the directions, she added, "We need to see to the horse.  while we're out, make sure they are comfortable. Is it all right to lea<B these bowls here for a while?" She had lifted a lid and was ^^^ the contents. "It's cooling off fast. It's too bad this can't be served hot- It would be better.". ^ "Of course, leave it," S'Armuna said, picking up her cup and draw ing the last of her tea as she watched the two strangers leave.  Perhaps Ayla wasn't an incarnation of the Great Mother, and ) dalar really was Marthona's son, but the idea that someday ^'r^ ,.^,,l^i ^o^ i-Jo- retribution had been weighing heavily on the would exact Her Who Served Her. After all, she was . After all, she was S'Armuna. She had exchange  onal identity for the power of the spirit world, and this Camp .charge, all the people, women and men. She had been en- with the care of the spiritual essence of the Camp, and Her ^depended on her. Looking from the view of outsiders, of the b had served to remind her of her calling, and the woman with powers, S'Armuna knew she had failed them. She only hoped ffl possible to redeem herself and to help the Camp recover a healthy life.  s 'Armuna stepped outside her lodge and watched the two vi«-; itors as they walked away toward the edge of the Camp. She saw du»' Attaroa and Epadoa, standing in front of the headwoman's lodge had turned to watch them, too. The shaman was about to go back in when i she noticed Ayla suddenly changing direction and heading for Ac ' palisade. Attaroa and her chief Wolf Woman also saw her veer and ^ both moved forward in quick strides to intercept the blond woman. ^ They reached the fenced enclosure almost simultaneously. The older 1 woman arrived a moment later.  Through the cracks, Ayla looked directly into the eyes and faces rf silent watchers on the other side of the sturdy poles. On close inspection, they were a sorry sight, dirty and unkempt, and dressed in ragged skins, but even worse was the stench emanating from the Holding. It was not only malodorous; to the perceptive nose of the medicine woman it was revealing. Normal body odors of healthy individuals did not bother her, even a certain amount of normal bodily wastes was not offensive, but she smelled sickness. The foetid breath of starvation, the noisome filth of excrement resulting from stomach ailments and fever, the foul odor of pus from infected, suppurating wounds, and even the putrid rot of progressed gangrene, all assaulted her senses and infuriated her.  Epadoa stepped in front of Ayla, trying to block her view, but she had seen enough. She turned and confronted Attaroa. "Why are these people held here behind this fence, like animals in a surround?" There was a gasp of surprise from the people who were watching when they heard the translation, and they held their breaths waiting for the headwoman's reaction. No one had ever dared to ask her before.  Attaroa glared at Ayla, who stared back with dauntless anger, i"^ were nearly equal in height, though the dark-eyed woman was a sha taller. Both were physically strong women, but Attaroa was rno muscular as a natural attribute of her heredity, while Ayla ha and wiry muscles developed from use.

"Because they deserve it!" the headwoman ne deserves that kind of treatment," Ayla retorted, before ia had a chance to translate. The woman instead respoke anment to Attaroa.  : do you know? You were not here. You don't know how they s," the dark-eyed woman said.  hey make you stay outside when it was cold? Did they not food and clothing?"

Epadoa shot her a threatening look.  : more can you do to me, Epadoa?" the woman said, stepping the forefront. "You've already taken my son, and my daugh-  ter will soon be gone, one way or another. I'm too old to care if r or die." 11 "They betrayed us," Epadoa said. "Now they all know whar happen if they try to run away." Attaroa gave no sign of approval or disapproval to indicate Epadoa had voiced her own feelings. Instead, with a bored look turned her back on the tense scene and walked to her lodge leavm Epadoa and her Wolf Women to guard the Holding. But she'stoi and spun around when she heard a loud, shrill whistle. A nc< expression of dread replaced her cold, cruel smile when she saw horses, who had been almost out of sight at the far edge of the f galloping toward Ayla. She quickly entered her earthlodge.  Feelings of stunned amazement filled the rest of the settlement as l blond woman, and the man with even lighter yellow hair, leaped i the backs of the animals and galloped away. Most of those remaina.  wished they could leave as quickly and easily, and many wondered i they would ever see the two again.    "I wish we could keep on going," Jondalar said, after they slowed down and he had pulled Racer up alongside Ayla and W ney.  "I wish we could, too," she said. "That Camp is so unbearable; JR fills me with anger and sadness. I'm even angry about S'Armuna allow^ ing it to go on for so long, though I pity her and understand hfll remorse. Jondalar, how are we going to free those boys and men?" » "We're going to have to work that out with S'Armuna," Jondalal said. "I think it's obvious that most of the women want things fl( change, and I'm sure many of them would help, if they knew what» do. S'Armuna will know who they are." } They had entered the open woods from the field, and they rode through its cover, though in places it was quite sparse, toward the nvtfj and then back around to the place they had left the wolf. As soon M they neared, Ayla signaled with a soft whistle, and Wolf bounded out to greet them, almost beside himself with happiness.

At a moment when both women were looking down, she silently stood up, holding her spear poised.

Ayla said, speaking in their language here." ° Unavoa appeared ready to break and run, and even Epadoa nervous and frightened.  "We were... we were hunting," Epadoa said.  "No horses here to chase over edge," Ayla said.  "We weren't hunting horses." "I know. You hunt Ayla andjondalar." Her sudden appearance, and the strange quality to the wa said the words in their language, made her seem exotic, from soi far away, perhaps even from another world. She made both want nothing more than to get as far away as possible fn woman, who seemed endowed with attributes that were more human.  "I think these two should return to their Camp, or they may the big feast tonight."

"All the more reason," the woman said. "All the signs indicate i-- she will have a boy. She will fight for the life of her baby, as wdll her own.

The food was more like !iat might be left at the end of the season, not what should available in the middle of winter. A few furs had been round Attaroa's raised platform near the large fire for the te rest of the people were bringing their own to sit upon ate.  na led Ayla and Jondalar toward Attaroa's fur-covered plat- they stood waiting until the headwoman swaggered to her was dressed in all her wolf-fur finery and necklaces of teeth, y» and shell, decorated with bits of fur and feathers. Most to Ayla was the staff she held, which was made from a id mammoth tusk.  ^ Attaroa commanded that the food be served and, with a points at Ayla, ordered that the share set aside for the men be taken i Holding, including the bowl Ayla and Jondalar had provided l she sat down on her platform. Everyone else took it as a signal down on their furs. Ayla noticed that the raised seat put the h woman in an interesting position. She was above everyone else w enabled her to see over the heads of the others and also to look d on them. Ayla recalled that there had been times when peoole stood on logs or rocks when they had something to say to a eroun they wanted everyone to hear, but it had always been a temoo position.  It was a powerful placement Attaroa had created, Ayla realize she observed the unconscious postures and gestures of the pe around. Everyone seemed to express toward Attaroa the attitud deference that the women of the Clan did when they sat in sileu front of a man, waiting for the tap on the shoulder that gave then right to make their thoughts known. But there was a difference was hard to characterize. In the Clan, she never sensed resentt from the women, which she felt here, or lack of respect from the i It was just the way things were done, inherent behavior, not fora coerced, and it served to make sure that both parties were paying < attention to the communication between them, which was expre primarily with signs and gestures.  While they were waiting to be served, Ayla tried to get a better at the headwoman's staff. It was similar to the Speaking Staff use Talut and the Lion Camp, except the carvings were very unusual, at all like Talut's staff, yet they seemed so familiar. Ayla recalled Talut brought out the Speaking Staff for various occasions inclu ceremonies, but particularly during meetings or arguments.  The Speaking Staff invested the one who held it with the rig!  speak, and allowed each person to make a statement, or express a f of view without interruption. The next person with something M then asked for the staff. In principle, only the one holding the Spea Staff was supposed to talk, although at Lion Camp, especially a midst of a heated discussion or argument, people didn't always their turn. But with some reminding, Talut was usually able to go people to abide by the principle, so that everyone who wanted given a chance to have a say.. c» "That is a most unusual and beautifully carved Speaking Ayla said. "May I see it?" ^ Attaroa smiled when she heard S'Armuna's translation. 5he it toward Ayla and closer to the firelight, but she did not give i -  rious that she had no intention of letting it go at all, and hat the headwoman was using the Speaking Staff to invest ts power.

Wolf felt nearly as strongly about Jondalar as did about Ayla, and he growled contentedly at the attention and proval he was getting from both of his humans.

She stepped toward visitors, eying the wolf warily.  "We are finally free of her," she said.  Ayla smiled; she could see the woman's anxiety. "Wolf wont you," she said.

"Epadoa should pay for the evil she has done." "She has more than that to pay for. What about the harm she did to these boys?" It was Ebulan who spoke. He stood back to let Ayla see two youngsters leaning on a cadaverous old man. 4 Ayla was startled when she saw the man; for an instant she thought she was looking at Creb! He was tall and thin, where the holy man rf the Clan had been short and stocky, but his craggy face and dark eyei held the same kind of compassion and dignity, and he obviously com.j manded the same kind of esteem. '¥ Ayla's first thought was to offer him the Clan gesture of respect by sitting at his feet and waiting for him to tap her shoulder, but she knew the action would be misunderstood. Instead, she decided to offer hia; the regard of formal courtesy. She turned to the tall man beside her. ;s "Jondalar, I cannot properly address this man without an introduce tion," she said. r1 He was quick to understand her sensitivity.

All the Wolf Women looked at each other with guilty expressiona.  How had she known? Among the S'Armunai, wolf meat was prohib" ited, and it was considered particularly bad for women.  The chief hunter studied the blond woman, trying to see if then was more to her than there appeared. Now that Attaroa was dead, and she knew she would not be killed for her actions, Epadoa felt a release.; She was glad it was over.

Somehow Ay la had assumed the wisdom and the s - Zeiandoni herself. The only time he had seen Ayla assume of a situation before was when someone was hurt, or sick and of her special skills. Then, when he thought of it, he realized th «' people were hurt and sick. Perhaps it wasn't so strange that Avia know what to do.    In the morning Jondalar took the horses and brought back tho ^ cessities they had taken when they left the Great Mother River &! went to get Whinney. It seemed so long ago, and it made him nJb that their Journey had been considerably delayed. They had bewr far ahead of the distance he thought they would have to cover to r the glacier that he had been sure they would make it in plenty oft Now they were well into winter, and they were farther away.  This Camp did need help, and he knew Ayla would not leave she had done everything she felt she could. He had promised to 1 too, and he was excited about the prospect of teaching Doban and ( others to work the flint, and the ones who wanted, to use the sn thrower, but a small knot of worry had begun. They had to cross 1 glacier before the spring melt made it too treacherous, and he wai to get under way again, soon.  S'Armuna and Ayla worked together to examine and treat the I and men of the Camp.

It was the youngsters, the ones who were nearing or barely ' adolescence, that made Ayla particularly angry. Even S'Armuna appalled.

Most people already felt that she ordinary woman, and many were saying that she was an of the Great Mother Herself; a living munai in human had come to take Attaroa and set the men free. What else in horses that came at her whistle? Or a wolf, huge even large northern breed, following her wherever she went and dy at her command?

A simple ceremony conducted by  B ^ -11 I ^B j the One Who Served finally returned the headwoman to the bo«irJa ' I the Great Mother Earth. ^^ .[ i A few even felt some grief. Epadoa had not expected to fepi 's thing, and yet she did. Because of the way most of the Camp felrJ couldn't express it, but Ayla could see from her body language L postures and expressions, that she was struggling with it. Doban'A exhibited strange behavior, and she guessed he was trying to deal u' his own mixed emotions. For most of his young life, Attaroa had ho.  the only mother he knew. He had felt betrayed when she turned him, but her love had always been erratic, and he couldn't entirely 1 go of his feelings for her.  Grief needed to be released. Ayla knew that from her own losse She had planned to try to treat the boy right after the burial, but d wondered if she should wait longer. This might not be the right di for it, but maybe having something else to concentrate on would I better for both of them. She approached Epadoa on the way back i the Camp.  "I'm going to try to reset Doban's dislocated leg, and I'm going i I i need help. Will you assist me?" ,n jr ; I I"' i'1 ~ "Won't it be painful for him?" Epadoa said. She recalled only u well his screams of pain, and she was beginning to feel protective i him. He was, if not her son, at least her charge, and she took seriously. Her life, she was sure, depended on it.  |ij || "I will put him to sleep. He won't feel it, though he will have son pain when he wakes up, and he will have to be moved very careful for some time," Ayla explained. "He won't be able to walk." "I will carry him," Epadoa said.  When they got back to the big lodge, Ayla explained to the boy th she wanted to try to straighten his leg.

She had been trained by the zeiandonia, and she knew dm such ideas were often encouraged. She had learned, and often em.  ployed, ways to misdirect people, to lead them into believing what she.  and they, wanted to believe. She didn't think of it as trickery--no one was more convinced of the rightness of her calling--but she used die means at her disposal to smooth the way and persuade others to follow.  People could often be helped by such means, especially some of those whose problems and illnesses had no discernible cause, except, perhaps, curses by powerful evil people.  Though she herself was not willing to accept all the rumors, S'Ar- muna did not discourage them. The people of the Camp wanted 0 believe that anything Ayla and Jondalar said was a pronouncement from the Mother, and she used their belief to set in place some necea- sary changes. When Ayla talked about the Mamutoi Council of Sister.  and Council of Brothers, for example, S'Armuna organized the Cany to set up similar Councils. When Jondalar mentioned finding someonK from another Camp to continue the training in flint-toolmaking that ht; had begun, she instigated plans to send a delegation to several othtf] S'Armunai Camps to renew ties with kin and reestablish friendships.    On a night that fell so cold and clear the stars blazed from th(| f the heavens, a group of people were clustered outside the entrance or w former headwoman's large earthlodge, which was becoming a cento- for community activities after it had served as a place for healing aKj recovery. They were talking about the mysterious twinkling lights , the sky, and S'Armuna was answering questions and offering lnte^^B'j tations. She had to spend so much time in the place--healing ww medicines and ceremonies, and gathering with people to make P ; and discuss problems--that she had begun to move some of her wvav^ in, and she often left Ayla and Jondalar alone in her small lodge.  arrangement was starting to resemble other Camps and ~av€,^ Ayla and Jondalar knew, with the lodging of the One Who Serv j Mother acting as a focus and gathering place for the people.  After the two visitors left the stargazers, with Wolf at their asked S'Armuna about the wolf that followed Ayla every- be One Who Served the Mother pointed to one of the bright be sky. "That is the Wolf Star," was all she said.    ys passed quickly. As the men and boys began to recover and needed her as a medicine woman, Ayla went out with those ; collecting the sparse winter foods.

"Am I bothering you, Ayla?" she asked.  "No, come in." The young, very pregnant woman entered and eased herself dw on the edge of a sleeping platform, across from Ayla. "S'Armuna U me you are leaving." "Yes, in a day or so." "I thought you were going to stay for the firing." "I wanted to, but Jondalar is anxious to go. He says we must cros ghcier before spring."

She handed I package to Ayla.  Inside the package was a small head of a lioness powerfully model out of clay. "Cavoa! This is beautiful. More than beautiful. It is t essence of a cave lioness. I didn't know you were so skilled." The young woman smiled. "You like it?" "I knew a man, a Mamutoi man, who was a carver of ivory, a fine artist. He showed me how to see things that are carved painted, and I know he would love this," Ayla said.  "I have carved figures out of wood, ivory, antler. I've been doing as long as I can remember.

She decided to pan with from; but only one, and she selected a good-size nodule, then put the rear away. , When Ayla went out, she noticed Cavoa leaving the large earthlodne as she entered. She smiled at the young woman, who smiled nervously back, and when she went in, she thought S'Armuna looked at her strangely. Jondalar's carving had created some worry, it seemed. Ayh; waited until another person had left the lodge, and S'Armuna wif, alone. ^1 "I have something I want to give you before I leave. I discovered this when I was living alone in my valley," she said, opening her palm to show her the stone. "I thought you might be able to make use of it for your Fire Ceremony." S'Armuna looked at it, then looked up at Ayla questioningly. ;; "I know it doesn't look like it, but there is fire inside this stone. L^tj me show you." 1 Ayla went to the fireplace, got out the tinder they used, and arranged small shavings of wood loosely around dried cattail fluff. She; placed sticks of kindling nearby, then bent down low and struck the iron pyrite with flint. A large hot spark was drawn off and fell on vac tinder, and when she blew on it, a small flame miraculously appeared.  She added kindling to keep it going, and when she looked up she saw the stunned woman gaping at her incredulously.  "Cavoa told me she saw a munai with your face, and now you maW fire appear. Are you... who they say you are?" „.  Ayla smiled. "Jondalar made that carving, because he loved rae' said he wanted to capture my spirit, and then he gave it to me. Its - a donii, or a munai.

She looked around and saw?  on the far side of the small lodge, staying out of view and beckon' her.  "What is it, Cavoa?" "I want to show you something, to see how you like it," the vn woman said. When Ayla got close, Cavoa took off her mitt. In hand was a small roundish object, the color of mammoth ivorv placed it carefully in Ayla's palm. "I just finished it," she said.  Ayla held it up and smiled with a look of wonder. "Cavoa! I h you were good. I didn't know you were this good," she said, caref examining the small carving of S'Armuna.  It was just the head of the woman, no hint of a body, not ew neck, but there was no doubt who the carving was meant to del The hair was pulled up into a bun near the top of the head, and narrow face was slightly skewed, with one side somewhat smaller t the other, yet the beauty and the dignity of the woman were evid It seemed to emanate from within the small work of art.  "Do you think it's all right? Do you think she'll like it?" Cavoa s "I wanted to make something special for her." "I would like it," Ayla said, "and I think it expresses your fee for her very well. You have a rare and wonderful Gift, Cavoa, but must be sure to use it well. There could be great power in it. S'Ann was wise to choose you as her acolyte." By evening, a howling blizzard was raging, making it dangerou move more than a few feet beyond the entrance of a lodge. S'Ann was reaching for a bunch of dried greenery hanging from the rack l the entryway, planning to add it to a new batch of herbs she mixing together for a potent drink she was preparing for the I Ceremony. The fire in the fireplace was burning low, and Ayla Jondalar had just gone to bed. The woman planned to retire as soo she finished.., Suddenly a blast of cold air and a flurry of snow accompanied opening of the heavy drape stretched across the entrance to the room.

It was mostly food that was gone. W they put all they could salvage together, it made a meager pile they realized the situation could have been worse.

The east-west course of the Great Mother River, which t followed, marked the line of a great battle between the most powe forces of the earth, waged in the infinitely slow motion of ge° time. To the south was the foreland of the high western mount.  whose uppermost reaches were never warmed by the gentle j' summer. The lofty prominences accumulated snow and ice y year and, farther back, the tallest peaks of the range glistened clear, cold air.. ji The highlands on the north were the basic crystalline roc  issif, rounded and smoothed vestiges of ancient mountains over eons of time.

While no longer the huge S Mother of rivers that she had been downstream, the Great ^cr was still substantial, and after a few days, true to char- 'Cparated once again into several channels.  ^ Half a day's travel beyond, they reached another large tri3 whose roiling confluence, tumbling down from higher ground l formidable, with icicles extended into frozen curtains and m '.°S broken ice lining both banks. No longer were the rivers joinin north coming from the uplands and foothills of the familiar mo OH they were leaving behind. This water came from the unfamiliar r to the west. Rather than cross the perilous river, or attempt to fcl it upstream, Jondalar decided to backtrack and cross the en branches of the Mother instead.  It turned out to be a good choice. Though some of the channels < wide and choked with ice along the edges, for the most part the fr water barely reached as high as the horses' flanks. They didn't d much about it until later that evening, but Ayla and Jondalar the horses, and the wolf had finally crossed the Great Mother River. A their dangerous and traumatic adventures on other rivers, they aco plished it with so little incident that it seemed an anticlimax, but t were not sorry.  In the deep cold of winter, simply traveling was dangerous enw Most people were snugly settled in warm lodges, and friends and would come looking if anyone was outside for too long. Ayla Jondalar were entirely on their own. If anything happened, they only each other, and their animal companions, to depend on.  The land gradually sloped upward, and they began to notice a su shift in the vegetation. Fir and larch appeared among the spruce pine near the river. The temperature on the plains of the river val was extremely cold; due to atmospheric inversions, often colder tha was higher in the surrounding mountains. Although snow and whitened the highlands that flanked them, snow seldom fell on river valley. The few light, dry sittings that did produced little buil on the frozen ground, except in hollows and depressions, and so times not even there. When snow was lacking, the only way they cc get drinking water for themselves and the animals was to use ti stone axes to chop ice from the frozen river and then melt it.  It made Ayla more aware of the animals that roamed the plains al the valley of the Mother. They were the same varieties as those t had seen on the steppes all along the way, but the cold-loving creat.  predominated. She knew these animals could subsist on the dry ration that was easily available on the subfreezing but essentially s" less plains, but she wondered how they found water.  She thought that wolves and other carnivores probably derived of their liquid requirement from the blood of those they nuD food, and they ranged over a large territory and could find pw  r )ge ice to chew. But what about horses and the other grazing me animals? How did they find water in a land that in a frozen desert? There was enough snow in some areas, but e barren regions of rock and ice. Yet no matter how dry, if lome kind of fodder, it was inhabited by animals.  tl still rare, Ayla saw more woolly rhinoceroses than she had »one place, and though they didn't herd together, whenever bos, they often saw musk-oxen, too. Both species preferred yindy, dry land, but the rhinos liked grass and sedge, and true to the goatlike creatures they were, browsed on wood- Large reindeer and the gigantic megaceroses with massive i shared the frozen land, and horses with thick winter coats, e was one animal that stood out among the populations in >f the upper course of the Great Mother River, it was mam- rer grew tired of watching the huge beasts.

After a year, the baby tushes were lost sd by permanent tusks that grew continually from then on.  tusks of mammoths were social adornments, important in s with their own kind, they also had a more practical func- were used to break up ice, and the ice-breaking abilities of were phenomenal.  : tune Ayla observed the practice, she had been watching a aales approach the frozen river. Several of them used their iwhat smaller and straighter than the ivory shafts of males, ice that was caught in the lee of rock crevices. It puzzled until she noticed a small one pick up a piece with her little >ut it in her mouth.  Ayla said. "That's how they get water, Jondalar. I was about that." ^ht. I never thought much about it before, but now that >n it, I think Dalanar said something about that. But there  are lots of sayings about mammoths. The only one I remenii?  'Never go forth when mammoths go north,' though you could same for rhinos." ^ "I don't understand that saying," Ay la said.  "It means a snowstorm is coming," Jondalar said. "They I, seem to know. Those big woollies don't like snow much. It cov their food. They can use their tusks and their trunks to brush some, but not when it gets really deep, and they get bogged don it. It's especially bad when it's thawing and freezing. They lie don night when it's still slushy from the afternoon sun, and by mm their fur is frozen to the ground. They can't move. They are eai hunt then, but if there are no hunters around and it doesn't thaw can slowly starve. Some have been known to freeze to death esoec little ones." "What does that have to do with going north?" "The closer you get to the ice, the less snow there is. Rernei how it was when we went hunting mammoths with the Mamutoi?  only water around was the stream coming from the glacier itself that was summer. In winter, that's all frozen." "Is that why there's so little snow around here?" "Yes, this region is always cold and dry, especially in winter. E one says it's because the glaciers are so close. They are on the m tains to the south, and the Great Ice is not very far north. Most o land in between is flathead... I mean Clan country. It starts a west of here." Jondalar noticed Ayla's expression at his slip of tongue, and he felt embarrassed. "Anyway, there's another sa about mammoths and water, but I can't remember exactly how it It's something like, 'If you can't find water, look for a mammoth.  "I can understand that saying," Ay la said, looking beyond I Jondalar turned to see.  The female mammoths had moved upstream and joined forces a few males. Several females were working on a narrow, almost < 'T-»l L.  cal, bank of ice that had built up along the river's edge. The 01 males, including one dignified elder with streaks of gray hair, w impressive, if less useful, tusks had grown so long that they ^ crossed in front, were scraping and gouging out huge chunks from the banks. Then, lifting them high with their trunks, the a moths threw the ice down with a loud crash to shatter into more pieces, all accompanied by bellowings, snortings, stomping5.  trumpetings. The huge woolly creatures seemed to be making a e of it.  The noisy business of breaking ice was a practice that all m J gi young ones only two or three years old, who had barely iby tushes, showed wear on the outside edges at the ends y two-inch tusks from scraping ice, and the tips of the prongs of ten-year-olds were worn smooth from moving up and down against the vertical surfaces. By the time the moths reached twenty-five, their tusks were beginning to rd, upward, and inward, and the way they used them ie lower surfaces began to show some of the wear of scrap- brushing aside what snow did fall on the dry grass and ; steppes.

But even broken ends vom smooth again by later scraping and gouging of ice.  ced that other animals had gathered around. The herds of lals, with their powerful tusks, broke up enough ice for including their young and old, and for a community of well. Many animals benefited by trailing close on the heels ; mammoths. The big woollies not only created piles of s of ice in winter that were chewed for moisture by animals hemselves, in summer they sometimes used their tusks and loles in dry riverbeds, which would fill with water.

But some A^ hunting took more of their time than they wished, and anything riSI took time made Jondalar edgy. ^.  They often supplemented their diet, which was heavily concentrate on lean meat, with the inner bark of conifers and other trees usuail» cooked into a broth with meat, and they were delighted when they found berries, frozen but still clinging to the bush.

Most of the foliage of seed-bearing herbs had long since disintegrated, the plants lying dormant until spring thaws would awaken them to new life. Ayla wished for the dried vegetables and fruits that had been destroyed by the wolves, though she didn't begrudge the supplies she had given to the S'Armuna.  Though Whinney and Racer were grass eaters almost exclusively all summer, Ayla noticed that their diet had extended to browsing on tw^ tips, chewing through to the inner bark of trees, and included a paroc" ular variety of lichen, the kind reindeer preferred. She collected some and tested small amounts on herself, then made some for both of than.  They found the taste strong but tolerable, and she was experimenting with ways to cook it.  Another source of winter food was small rodents such as voles, mice, and lemmings; not the animals themselves--Ayla usually let WoaW6 those as a reward for helping to sniff them out--but their nests.  looked for the subtle features that hinted at a burrow, then bro through the frozen ground with a digging stick to find the small anii""" surrounded by the seeds, nuts, and bulbs they had laid by. ,g And Ayla also had her medicine bag.

S'Armuna had made oblique references to their strong aversion r •?  ones they called flatheads, but she felt sure no Zeiandonii would be as cruel as the woman who had been the leader of the S'Annun'' "I don't know how Attaroa could do the things she did Tondal '» Ay la remarked as they were finishing an evening meal.

The river split out again into several channels across a ism that formed an embayment. The southern and northern k °fthe valley maintained their characteristic differences, but the base rock was cracked and down-faulted to great depths the river and the limestone foreland of the high southern moi, Toward the west was the steep limestone edge of a fault line course of the river turned northwest.  The east end of the lowland basin was also bordered by a fault caused not so much by uplifting of the limestone as by the deorcs"^ of the land of the embayment. Toward the south, the land spread on a level grade for some distance before it rose up toward the mount tains, but the granite plateau in the north drew closer to the river umal it was rising steeply just across the water. ;| They camped within the low embayment. In the valley near d»' river, the smooth gray bark and the bare branches of beech made an appearance among the spruce, fir, pine, and larch; the area was omJ tected enough to shelter the growth of a few large-leafed deciduoc; trees. Milling around near the trees in seeming confusion was a smaB herd of mammoths, both females and males. Ayla edged closer to see3 what was going on. ; One mammoth was down, a giant of an elder with enormous tush that crossed in front. She wondered if it was the same group they had seen earlier breaking ice. Could there be two mammoths who were so old in the same region? Jondalar walked up beside her.  "I'm afraid he's dying. I wish there was something I could do for him," Ayla said.  "His teeth are probably gone. Once that happens, there is nothing anyone can do, except what they are doing. Staying with him, keeping him company," Jondalar said.  "Perhaps none of us can ask for more," Ayla said.  In spite of their relatively compact size, each adult mammoth consumed large quantities of food every day, primarily woody-stemmed tall grass and occasional small trees. With such a rough diet, their teeth were essential. They were so important that a mammoth's lifespan was determined by its teeth.  A woolly mammoth developed several sets of large grinding molars throughout its span of some seventy years, usually six to a side botu upper and lower. Each tooth weighed about eight pounds and was especially adapted to grinding coarse grasses. The surface was mad up of many extremely hard, thin, parallel ridges--plates of denOiw covered with enamel--and had higher crowns and more ridges tua" the teeth of any other of its species, before or since. Mammoths primarily grass eaters.

Mammoths were even known to bury animals, including humans.    i Jondalar and their four-legged traveling companions found getting steeper and more difficult when they left behind the id the mammoths. They were approaching a gorge. A foot ent massif of the north had stretched too far south and was e dividing waters of the river. They climbed higher as the d through the narrow defile, moving too fast to freeze but dth it ice floes from quieter sections farther west. It was see moving water after so much ice.

"I would not want to fall into that," Ayla said, shuddering at A» thought.  "Nor would I," Jondalar responded.  Ayla's gaze was drawn to another site in the distance. "Where are those clouds of steam coming from, Jondalar?" she asked. "It's fre®.  ing, and the hills are covered with snow." "There are pools of hot water over there, water warmed by the hot breath of Doni Herself. Some people are afraid to go near such placca, but the people I want to visit live near such a deep hot well, or so they told me. The hot wells are sacred to them, even though some smell very bad. It's said they use the water to cure illness." ,; "How long before we reach those people you know? The ones wool use water to cure illness," she asked. Anything that might add to her wealth of medical knowledge always piqued her interest. Besides, food was getting scarcer, or they didn't want to take the time to look for it --but they had gone to bed hungry a couple of days.  The slope of the land increased noticeably beyond the last flat basin.  They were hemmed in by highlands on both sides as the mountain.  pressed in. The mantel of ice to the south was increasing in height at they continued west. Far to the south and still somewhat west, tw® peaks soared far above all the other rugged mountaintops, one higher than the other, like a mated pair watching over their brood of children.  Where the highland leveled out near a shallower place in the river, Jondalar turned south, away from the river, toward a cloud of rising steam in the distance. They climbed a low ridge and looked down from the top across a snow-covered meadow at a steaming pool of water near a cave.  Several people had noticed their approach and stared in constero^ tion, too shocked to move.

"But I ha never seen a wolf accompany people of his own free will before horses either, for that matter." "It is understandable," Ayla said. "I will take you to meet the hon later.

Laduni nodded, fighting his impulse to ask them further questiw knowing the whole Cave would want to hear their stories. "I ha welcomed you, and I invite you to come inside to share warmth ai food, and a place to rest, but I think I should go first and explain abc you to the rest of the Cave." Laduni walked back toward the group gathered in front of a lar opening in the side of a rock wall. He explained about meeting Jondal a few years before, when he was starting on his Journey, and invid) him to visit on his way back. He mentioned that Jondalar was relat to Dalanar, and emphasized that they were people, not some kind threatening spirits, and that they would tell them about the horses ai the wolf. "They should have some interesting stories to tell," he co eluded, knowing what an enticement that would be to a group people who had been essentially cavebound since the beginning winter and were getting bored.  The language he spoke was not the Zeiandonii he had spoken to t travelers, but after listening for a while, Ayla was sure she hea similarities. She realized that although they had a different stress a) pronunciation, Losadunai was related to Zeiandonii in the same - that S'Armunai, and Sharamudoi for that matter, were related to m mutoi. This language even had a link with S'Armunai. She had un stood some of the words and had picked up the gist of some o comments. She would be speaking with these people in a few ^Y.

She is living with her mate's Cave. They had more room, but it's not too far away and we see her, and the children, regularly." There was satisfaction and joy in Laduflis voice.  "I hope Thonolia is a child ofThonolan's spirit. I'd like to think that there is still a piece of his spirit in this world," Jondalar said.  Could it happen so fast? Jondalar wondered. He only spent one night with her. Was his spirit so potent? Or, if Ayla is right, could Thonolan have started a baby growing inside Filonia with the essence of his manhood that night we stayed with them? He remembered the woman he had been with.  "How is Lanalia?" he asked.  "She is fine. She is visiting kin at another Cave. They are "Y"^1, arrange a mating for her. A man lost his mate and is left with ua.  young children at his hearth.

Charoli and his band happened to see her alone, and they all took her..." "All of them? Took her? By force?" Jondalar said, appalled. "Agiri, not yet a woman. I can't believe it!" "All of them," Laduni said, with a cold anger that was worse than any heat of the moment. "And we will not put up with it! I don't know if they got tired of flathead females, or what excuse they gave themselves, but that was too much. They caused her pain, and bleeding.  She says she wants nothing more to do with men, ever again. She has refused to go through with her womanhood rites." "That's terrible, but it's hard to blame her. It is not the way for a young woman to learn of Doni's Gift," Jondalar said.  "Her mother is afraid that if she forgoes honoring the Mother with the ceremony, she will never have children." "She could be right, but what can be done?" Jondalar asked.  "Her mother wants Charoli dead, and she wants us to declare a blood feud against his Cave," Laduni said. "Revenge is her right, but a blood feud can destroy everyone. Besides, it's not Charoli's Cave tua has caused the trouble. It's that band of his, and some of them aren even from the Cave of Charoli's birth. I've sent a message to Toinasi, the hunt leader there, and put an idea to him." "An idea?

Mamut was training me, but I have never been initiated," Ayla explained.  "But born to it! You must be chosen of the Mother, too, along with all the rest," the man said, obviously delighted.  "Losaduna, you have not greeted her yet," the plump woman chided.  The man looked befuddled for a moment. "Oh, I guess not. Always these formalities. In the name of Duna, the Great Earth Mother, may I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi, Chosen by the Lion Camp, and Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth." The woman beside him sighed and shook her head. "He got it mixed up, but if it was some little-known ceremony, or legend about the Mother, he wouldn't forget a bit of it," she said.  Ayla couldn't help smiling. She had never met One Who Served the Mother who seemed more unlikely to function in that capacity.

His behavior calmed Solandia, and after serving her guests a ing hot tea, she introduced her children, then went back to ore the meal she had started. The presence of the animal slippedl^1 back of her mind, but the children were fascinated. Ay la studied trying to be unobtrusive. The oldest of the four youngsters L was a boy of about ten years, she guessed. There was a girl of dc seven years, Dosalia, and another of four or so, Neladia. Thouehl baby was not yet walking, that did not limit his mobility. He was m the crawling stage and was fast and efficient on all fours. 'I The older children were wary of Wolf, and the elder of the riA picked up the baby and held him while they watched the animal txtf after a while when nothing happened, she put him down. While lon- dalar spoke with Losaduna, Ayla began to set out their things. TheM was spare bedding for guests and she hoped she would have time 4 clean their sleeping furs while they were here. | Suddenly there was a peal of babyish laughter. Ayla caught her breath and looked in the corner where she had left Wolf. There w« absolute silence in the rest of the dwelling space as everyone stared 1 wonder and awe at the baby, who had crawled to the corner and w-- sitting beside the large wolf, pulling on his fur. Ayla glanced at Solan and saw her staring transfixed as her precious baby boy proceeded to poke and prod and pull at the wolf, who simply wagged his tail aod looked pleased.  Finally Ayla walked over, picked up the child, and brought him to his mother.  "You're right," Solandia said with amazement, "that wolf loves children!  If I hadn't seen it myself, I would never have believed it." It wasn't long before the rest of Solandia's children approached the wolf who liked to play. After a small problem with some teasing by the oldest boy, which Wolf responded to by taking the child's hand a his teeth and growling, but not biting down, Ayla explained that they had to treat him with respect. Wolfs reaction frightened the boy ]vsk enough to make him pay attention. When they went outside, w children of the community watched Solandia's four and the wolf W- fascination.

"Thonolan was in a hurry to get as far along the Great Mother Ri as we could. He didn't want to stop," Jondalar explained, "and stayed on this side of the river. We were lucky." When the gather broke up, Ayla was glad to go to bed in a warm, dry place with wind, and she fell asleep quickly.    Ayla smiled at Solandia, who was sitting beside the fireplace nurs Micheri. She had awakened early and decided to make the morning for herself and Jondalar. She looked for the pile of wood or dried dm whatever fuel they used, that was usually kept nearby, but all she's was a pile of brown stones.  "I want to make some tea," she said. "What do you bum? Ify011 me where it is, I'll go get it." "Don't have to. Plenty here," Solandia said.  Ayla looked around and, still not seeing the fireplace burning rial, wondered if she had been understood.  Solandia saw her puzzled look and smiled. She reached o  one of the brown stones. "We use this, burning stone," she A the stone from her hand and examined it closely. She saw je wood grain, yet it was definitely stone, not wood. She had i anything quite like it before; it was lignite, brown coal, a etween peat and bituminous coal.

Wolves broke inr cache and got our traveling food," Jondalar said.  "You plan to cross the glacier with the horses?" Losaduna asked "Yes, of course," Ayla said.  "What will you do for food for them? And two horses must dri much more than two people--what will you do for water when eve thing is frozen solid?" the One Who Serves asked.  Ayla looked at Jondalar.

You don't have to worry about getting them wet, a it would be much less to carry," Losaduna said.  Jondalar looked thoughtful, and then a big happy grin warmed face. "That would do it! We can put them in the bowl boat--it v slide across the ice even with a heavy load--and add a few other stoi to use as a base for a fireplace. I've been worrying about that for!  long... I can't thank you enough, Losaduna." Ayla discovered by accident, when she happened to overhear s of the people talking about her, that they considered her unu speech mannerism to be a Mamutoi accent, although Solandia thoi it was a minor speech impediment. No matter how hard she tried, s could not overcome the difficulty she had with certain sounds, but s was glad that no one else seemed very concerned about it.  Over the next few days, Ayla became better acquainted with t group of Losadunai who lived near the hot well--the group was call a "Cave" whether they lived in one or not. She particularly enjoy the people whose dwelling space they shared, Solandia, Losaduna, s the children, and she realized how much she had missed the coinp of friendly people who behaved in a normal way. The woman the language ofjondalar's people reasonably well, with some L nai words mixed in, but she and Ayla had no trouble underst each other.  She was even more drawn to the mate of the One Who Served w she discovered they had a common interest. Although Losad was the one who was supposed to have learned about plants, he and medicines, it was actually Solandia who had picked up of the lore. The arrangement reminded Ayla of Iza and Creb, adne the Cave's illnesses with practical herbal medicine, exorcism of spirits and other unknown harmful emana- r mate. Ayla was also intrigued by Losaduna with his listories, legends, myths, and the spirit world--the intel- cts she was forbidden to know when she lived with the she was coming to appreciate the wealth of knowledge he as he discovered her genuine interest in the Great Earth the nonmaterial world of the spirits, and her quick intelli- imazing ability to memorize, he was eager to pass on the ut even understanding them completely, Ayla was soon I verses of legends and histories and the precise content and ials and ceremonies. He was fluent in Zeiandonii, though with a strong Losadunai flavor in the expression and phras- ; the languages so close that most of the rhythm and meter s were retained although some of the rhyme was lost. Even iring to both of them were the minor differences, and many between his interpretation and the received wisdom of the josaduna wanted to know the variations and divergences, und herself being not only an acolyte, as she had been with t a teacher of sorts, explaining the eastern ways, at least lew.  was also enjoying the Cave of people, and becoming aware h he had missed having a variety of individuals around.

"I want to do son».  thing to try to help Madenia, and an Honoring Ceremony might be exactly the right thing. She won't get out of bed.

"What a terrible ordeal it must have been for her," Jondalar said^ shuddering at the thought. „, "Yes. I was hoping she would be recovering from it by now. I wonder if a cleansing ritual at the Hot Well would help," he said, bat it was obvious he didn't expect an answer from Jondalar. His mild was already lost in thought as he began to consider the ritual. Su<fc denly, he looked up. "Do you know where Ayla is? I think I'll ask her to join us.

"I don't know yet," Losaduna said. "I feel, under the circumstan that a woman should be with us. Madenia knows I am the One Serves the Mother, but I am a man, and she has a fear of men r now. I believe it would be very helpful if she would talk about it sometimes it's easier to talk to a sympathetic stranger.

"Is there anything I should not say or do?" "You have a natural sensitivity and will know that yourself. ' have a rare, natural ability for new language, too. I am genuil amazed at how quickly you have learned to speak Losadunai, grateful, too, for Madenia's sake," Losaduna said.  Ayla felt uncomfortable with his praise and glanced away. It di seem especially amazing to her. "It is quite similar to Zeiandonii," said.  He could see her discomfort and didn't make any further issue o They both looked up when Solandia came in.  "Everything's ready," she said. "I'll take the children and have place prepared for you when you are through. Oh, and that remi me, Ayla, do you mind if I take Wolf?

The two of them pulled her to a sitting position, then helped her to her feet. Madenia didn't resist, but she didn't cooperate. With one m each side, they led her out of the enclosed space, and then out ofri» cave. The girl didn't seem to notice the freezing, snow-covered ground; even with bare feet. They guided her toward a large conical tent thti Ayla hadn't noticed before. It was tucked away around the side of the cave, screened by rocks and brush, and steam came from the smoke hole at the top. A strong smell of sulfur permeated the air. «| After they entered, Losaduna pulled a leather covering across thfcl opening and fastened it. They were in a small entrance space that partitioned from the rest of the interior by heavy leather drapes, m moth hide, Ayla thought. Although the temperature was freezing o it was warm inside. A double-walled tent had been erected over a spring, which provided the heating; but for all the steam, the w were reasonably dry. Though some moisture collected, beading up running down the sloping sides to the edge of the ground cloth, n of the condensation occurred on the inside of the outer wall, where cold outside met the steamy warmth inside. The insulating air spac between was warmer, keeping the inner liner nearly dry.  Losaduna directed them to undress, and when Madenia did n he told Ayla to do it for her. The young woman clutched at her when Ayla attempted to remove them, staring with wide eyes One Who Served the Mother.  "Try to get her clothes off, but if she won't let you, bring with them on," Losaduna said, then slipped behind the heavy allowing a wisp of steam to escape. Once the man left, Ayla r" to ease the girl's clothing off, then quickly undressed herself Madenia to the room beyond the drape.  Clouds of steam obscured the space inside with a warm blurred outlines and concealed details, but Ayla could make out a lined with stones beside a steaming natural hot spring. A hole c ing the two was plugged with a carved wooden stopper. On side of the pool, a hollowed-out log, which brought in cold wa tream, had been lifted and made to slope the wrong way, tie flow from entering the pool. When the billowing steam a moment, she saw that the inside of the tent was painted ds, many of them pregnant, most of them faded from water on, along with enigmatic triangles, circles, trapezoids, and ictric shapes.  the pools, extending not quite all the way to the wall of the pads of felted mouflon wool had been placed on top of the th, wonderfully soft and warm under bare feet.

Then, placing his left foot on one of the wool sen the two parallel lines, he started walking around the pool ecisely laid-out path.

They made a complete circuit of the ie hot spring, stepping over the cold water inlet and across a t trench. As he started around a second time, Losaduna iting in a singsong voice, invoking the Mother with names >a.

The man re- uivocation over and over as they circled the water for the ie.' laced his left foot between the parallel lines of the starting po the third circle, he had reached "Most Compassionate ^ our plea," but instead of repeating, he continued with, 60S "0 Duna, Great Earth Mother, one of Your own has been h ^ One of Your own has been violated.

Then, from an alcove at the side of raised platform of earth, Losaduna took a bowl. It was made ofst and probably originally had a natural bowl shape, but it had t deepened by pecking at it with a hard hammerstone. The bottom < was blackened. He filled the bowl with water from a small water that was also in the niche, added dried leaves from a small basket, put the stone bowl directly on top of the hot coals.  Then, in a flat area of fine dry soil surrounded by wool pads, made a mark with the bone knife. Suddenly, Ayla understood v the bone implement was. The Mamutoi had used a similar tool to nn marks in the dirt, to keep track of scores and gambling counts, to | hunting strategies, and as a storytelling knife, drawing picture illustrations. As Losaduna continued making marks, Ayla realized was using the knife to help tell a story, but not one meant sunplj entertain. He told it in the chanting singsong that he had used to ffl his plea, drawing birds to emphasize and reinforce the points wanted to stress. Ayla soon realized that the story was an allcgw retelling of the attack on Madenia, using birds as the characters.  The young woman was definitely responding now, identiiyi"?  the young female bird he was telling about, and suddenly,^.  sob, she began to cry.

The water ran off away from the pool and between A?  cracks of the paving stones. Then the One Who Served the Mother uS them back to the hot pool, chanting wordlessly again.  As they sat and soaked, almost floating in the mineralized watw Ayla felt completely relaxed. The hot pool reminded her of the M.  mutoi sweat baths, but was, perhaps, even better. When Losadmr decided they had had enough, he reached down into the deep end rf the pool and removed a wooden stopper. As the water began to run out of the deep outlet trench, the man began to shout, which shocked her for a moment.  "Evil spirits, go! Cleansing waters of the Mother, take away all trace» of the touch of Charoli and all of his men. Impurities, run out with the water, leave this place. When this water is gone, Madenia will be cleansed, purified. The powers of the Mother have made her as she was before!" They walked out of the water.  Not stopping for their clothes, Losaduna led them out. They weft so warm from the hot water that the cold wind and the freezing ground on their bare skin felt refreshing. The few people who were out ignored them or turned their heads aside as they passed. With an unpleasant feeling, Ayla was suddenly reminded of another time when people looked directly at her but refused to see her. But this wasn't like bsaaf, cursed by the Clan. She could tell that the people really did see them?  They just affected not to, more as a courtesy than a curse. The walk cooled them down quickly, and by the time they reached the ceremo.  nial shelter, they were happy to find soft dry blankets to wrap theint selves in and hot mint tea.  Ayla looked at her hands curved around the cup. They were wnn.  kled, but absolutely clean! When she began to comb her hair wlth^ implement with several teeth made of bone, she noticed that her j squeaked when she pulled it through her fingers. ^| "What was that soft, slippery foam?" she asked. "It cleans like soapj root, but much more thoroughly." "Solandia makes it," Losaduna said. "It has something to do wood ashes and fat, but you'll have to ask her.". , When she finished her own, Ayla began to comb Madenia s "How do you make the water so hot?".  The man smiled.

Ayla woke up feeling more rested and refreshed than she could ever remember. She smiled lazily to herself and reached for Jondalar, but he was up and gone already. She felt a moment of disappointment, then remembered that he had awakened her to remind her that he was going hunting with Laduni and some of the hunters, and to ask was again if she wanted to join them.

"I guess you can," Solandia said.  Ayla looked down at the wolf who was looking up at her exoec.  tantly. "Watch the baby, Wolf," she said. He yipped, seemingly in response.  "I've got some good mammoth fat that I rendered out last fall" Solandia said as they walked to the area of her enclosed dwelling space.  "We had good luck hunting mammoth last year. That's why we still have so much fat, and a good thing, too. It would have been a hard winter without it. I've started the fat melting." They reached the en- tranceway just as the children were running out, carrying the young.  est. "Don't lose Micheri's mitts," Solandia called out after them.  Verdegia and Madenia were already inside. "I brought some ashes," Verdegia said. Madenia just smiled, a bit hesitantly.  Solandia was pleased to see her willing to get up out of bed and be around people again. Whatever they did at the hot spring, it seemed to have helped. "I put some cooking stones in the fire for tea. Madenia, would you make some for us?" she asked. "Then I'll use the rest to reheat the water melting the fat." "Where do you want these ashes?" Verdegia asked.  "You can mix them with mine. I started them leaching, but not long ago." "Losaduna said you use fat and ashes," Ayla commented.  "And water," Solandia added.  "That seems to be a strange combination." "Yes, it is." "What made you decide to mix those things together? I mean, how did you come to make it? The first time?" Solandia smiled. "It was really an accident. We had been hunting^ had a fire going outside in a fireplace with a deep pit, and some w mammoth meat roasting over it. It started to rain, hard. I grabbed the meat, spit and all, and ran for cover. As soon as it let up, we head back here to the cave, but I forgot a good wooden cooking bowl, aa went back for it the next day.

"What's wrong? Did something happen to the baby?" the said, rushing out after her. Everyone else followed behind anc the mouth of the cave.  "Look!" Dosalia said. They all looked outside. "The babv i ing!" There was Micheri, standing up beside the wolf, hanging on (n h- fur, with a big self-satisfied smile, taking unsteady steps as Wolfca ^ fully and slowly moved forward. Everyone smiled with relief and ri<-- j delight. ^BB | "Is that wolf smiling?" Solandia asked. "It looks to me as thourii )r ^ is. He seems to be so pleased with himself that he's smiling." "I think he is, too," Ayla said. "I have often thought he could smile " "It's not only for ceremony, Ayla," Losaduna was saying. "We often 1 use the hot waters just to soak. If you want to take Jondalar in just to I relax, we have no objections. The Sacred Waters of the Mother are like I Her other Gifts to Her children. They are meant to be used and ' enjoyed, and appreciated. Just as this tea you made should be appreciated," he added, holding up the cup.  Nearly the whole Cave, those that had not gone hunting, were silting around a fireplace in the open central area of the cave. Most meals : were very unstructured, except for special occasions. The people sometimes ate separately, in family groups, and sometimes with others.  This time, those who had stayed at the cave had stopped for a midday meal and eaten together, largely because they were all interested in the visitors. The meal consisted of a hearty meat soup of lean, dried deer, made rich with the addition of some mammoth fat, which made it filling and satisfying enough. They were finishing off with tea that Ayla had made, and all had remarked on how good it was.  "When they come back, maybe we will use the pool. I think he'd enjoy a hot soak, and I'd like to share it with him," Ayla said.  "You'd better warn her, Losaduna," a woman said, with a knowing smile. She had been introduced as Laduni's mate.  "Warn me of what, Laronia?" Ayla said.  "Sometimes you have to choose between the Mother's Gifts.' "What do you mean?" "She means the Sacred Waters can be too relaxing," Solandia said.  "I still don't understand," Ayla said, frowning. She knew everyone was talking about the subject, and there was an element of hum involved.. i^ "If you take Jondalar for a hot soak, it will relax the strength ng^ out of his manhood," Verdegia said, more direct than the others, he a couple of hours before it can stand up again.

I returned from the dwelling space with her sewing kit and some g she wanted to repair. With everyone crowded around to see tther amazing thing brought by the travelers, she took a small Sr out of her kit--it had come from the lightweight, hollow leg rd--and shook two ivory needles out of it. She handed one to ia.  woman examined the highly polished miniature shaft closely.  brought to a sharp point at one end, somewhat like an awl. The »d was a bit thicker and, surprisingly, had a very small hole TO all the way through. She thought about it, and suddenly got u^ of what it was for. "Did you say this was a thread-puller?" a» handing it to Laronia.  "Yes. I'll show you how I use it," Ayla said, separating a thin of sinew from a fibrous thicker strand. She wet the end and srnor it to a point, then waited for it to dry. The thread of tendon hard "lca slightly and held its shape. She threaded it through the hole at the ht end of the tiny ivory shaft, then put it aside for the moment. Nexfk?  picked up a small flint tool with a sharp point and used it to poke hnl near the edges of a garment whose stitches along a side seam had oullni out, a few of them tearing through the leather in the process. The ncu.  holes were back slightly from the previous ones.  Once she had made the holes for a new seam, Ayla settled down tn demonstrate the new implement. She put the point of the ivory needip through the holes in the leather and, grasping the small shaft, pulled the thread through, ending with a flourish.  "Oooh!" The people seated nearby, especially the women, breathed out a collective sigh. "Look at that!" "She didn't have to pick the thread out, she pulled it right through." "Can I try that?" Ayla passed the garment around and let them experiment, explaining and showing, and telling them how the idea had come to her, and how everyone at Lion Camp had helped her to develop and make it.  "This is a very well-made awl," Solandia commented, examining it closely.  "Wymez, of the Lion Camp, made it. He also made the borer that was used to make the hole that the thread goes through," Ayla said.  "That would be a very difficult tool to make," Losaduna said.  "Jondalar says Wymez is the only flint knapper he's ever met who is as good as Dalanar, and, possibly, a little better." "That's high praise from him," Losaduna said. "Everyone acknowledges Dalanar as the master stoneworker. His skill is known even on this side of the glacier, among the Losadunai." "But Wymez is also a master." They all turned in surprise at the sound of the voice that had just spoken, and saw Jondalar, Laduni, and several others coming into the cave, bringing with them an ibex they had killed.  "You had luck!" Verdegia said. "And if no one minds, I'd like to have the skin. I've been wanting some ibex wool to make bedding lo." Madenia's Matrimonial." She wanted to get her bid in before anyone else.  "Mother!" Madenia said, embarrassed. "How can you talk about a Matrimonial?" "Madenia must have First Rites before any Matrimonial can be co sidered," Losaduna said...1 "As far as I'm concerned, she can have the hide," Laronia s ver she wants to use it for."

We're having a Mother Festi- norrow," Laronia said.  37' «i r-r} i , he people of the Cave of the Sacred Hot Springs were anrid.  paring the Festival to Honor the Mother with great enthusiasm. In the deep of winter, when life was usually most dull and boring, Ayla and Jondalar had arrived and provoked enough excitement to keep the Cave stimulated for a long time, and with the inevitable storytelling that would result, the interest would last for years. From the moment they rode up, sitting on the backs of horses and followed by the Wolf Who Liked Children, everyone had been buzzing with speculation. They had enthralling stories to tell about their travels, arresting new ideas to share, and fascinating devices like spear-throwers and thread-pullers to demonstrate.  Now everyone was talking about something magical that the woman would show them during the ceremony, something having to do with fire, like their burning stones. Losaduna had mentioned it while they were eating their evening meal. The visitors had also promised to give a demonstration of the spear-thrower in the field outside the cave so everyone could see its possibilities, and Ayla was going to show what could be done with a sling. But even the promised demonstrations did not pique their curiosity as much as the mystery involving fire.  Ayla discovered that constantly being the center of attention could be as exhausting, in a different kind of way, as constantly traveling.  All evening people had plied her with eager questions and sought her opinion and ideas on subjects about which she had no knowledge. By the time the sun was setting, she was tired and didn't feel like talking any more. Soon after dark she left the gathering around the fire in the central part of the cave to go to bed. Wolf went with her and Jondalar followed shortly afterward, leaving the Cave free to gossip and speculate in their absence.  In the sleeping area allocated to them within the ceremonial aw dwelling space of Losaduna, they puttered around with preparao for the next day, then crawled into their furs. Jondalar held her an 1 A hie Sl(?" considered making the initial overtures that Ayla considered ni-> o nal" to couple, but she seemed nervous and distracted, and he w himself.

In the distance, the ivory- jcarp face of a rock wall, pocked with caves and textured with black '.sweeping up and around into roomy cliff overhangs, almost gleamed in k blazing down from high in the clear azure sky.

A longish, somewhat flat, column-shaped boulder, darker fie creamy matrix of limestone that held it, leaned over the edge as if m place just as it started to tumble down. The stone not only gave the ''that it would fall any moment, making her uneasy, but she knew "ig about it was important; something she should remember, something lihne, or was supposed to do--or wasn't supposed to do.  Closed her eyes trying to recall. She saw darkness, thick, velvet, palpable  darkness, as utterly lacking in light as only a cave deep in a mountain could h.  A tiny flickering of light appeared in the distance and she groped her way aln» a narrow passage toward it. As she neared, she saw Creb with other rnoa-u ^ and she suddenly felt great fear. She didn't want that memory and auicU' opened her eyes. J And found herself on the bank of the small river that wound its way alon the base of the wall. She looked across the water and saw Creb trudpinp uh path toward the falling stone formation. She had gotten behind him and now didn't know how to cross the river to catch up. She called after him, "Creb Fm sorry. I didn't mean to follow you into the cave." He turned around and beckoned to her again, signaling great urpencv "Hurry," he signed from across the river, which bad become wider and deeper and full of ice. "Don't wait any longer! Hurry!" The ice was expanding, taking him farther away. "Wait for me! Creb, don't leave me here!" she cried.    "Ayla! Ayla, wake up! You're dreaming again," Jondalar said, shaking her gently.  She opened her eyes and felt a great sense of loss and a strangely intense fear. She noticed the hide-covered walls of the dwelling space and a reddish glow from the fireplace as she looked at the shadowed silhouette of the man beside her. She reached out and clung to him.  "We have to hurry, Jondalar! We have to leave here right away," she said.  "We will," he said. "As soon as we can. But tomorrow is the Mother Festival, and then we have to decide what we need to take to cross the ice." "Ice!" she said. "We have to cross a river of ice!" "Yes, I know," he said, holding her and trying to calm her. "But we have to plan how we're going to do it with the horses and Wolf. We'll need food, and a way to get water for all of us. The ice is frozen solid up there." "Creb said to hurry. We have to leave!" "As soon as we can, Ayla. I promise, as soon as we can," Jondalar said, feeling a nagging edge of worry. They did need to leave and g across the glacier as soon as possible, but they couldn't go before Mother Festival, could they?    Though it did little to warm the freezing air, the late afternoon s streamed through the branches of trees, which broke up the corus ing rays but did not block the blinding western light. To the east, glaciered mountain peaks, reflecting the brilliant orb that was des  »fiery clouds, were suffused with a soft rosy glow that seemed late from within the ice.

What she is going to show you kable." >e people excitedly began making their way back into the cave from the large open mouth, Ayla noticed Madenia talking with iends and was glad to see that she was smiling. Many had ited on how pleased they were to see her joining in the group's s, though she was still shy and withdrawn. Ayla could not help ^ what a difference it made when people cared.

He picked up a small stick w'H, pitch-dipped end, held it to the fire until it caught, then turned arn '?  and walked to the stone wall of the cave.  With his body blocking the view, Ayla could not see what he doing, but when a glowing light spread out around him, she knew k» had lit a fire of some kind, probably a lamp. He made some rnotin and began chanting a familiar litany, the same repetition of the varini names of the Mother that he had chanted during Madenia's cleansim.  ritual. He was invoking the spirit of the Mother.  When he backed away and turned to face the gathering, Ayla saw that the glow came from a stone lamp he had lit in a niche in the cave wall. The fire cast dancing shadows, larger than life, of a small dunai and highlighted the exquisitely carved figure of a woman with substan tial motherly attributes—large breasts and rounded stomach, not preg nant but well endowed with reserves of stored fat.  "Great Earth Mother, Original Ancestor and Creator of All Life Your children have come to show appreciation, to thank You for all Your Gifts, great and small, to honor You," Losaduna intoned, and the people of the Cave joined in. "For the rocks and stones, the bones of the land that give of their spirit to nourish the soil, we have come to honor You. For the soil that gives of its spirit to nourish the plants that grow, we have come to honor You. For the plants that grow and give of their spirit to nourish the animals, we have come to honor You. For the animals that give of their spirit to nourish the meat-eaters, we have come to honor You. And for all of them that give of their spirit to feed and clothe and protect Your children, we have come to honor You." Everyone knew all the words. Even Jondalar, Ayla noticed, had joined in, though he said the words in Zeiandonii. She soon began repeating the "honor" part, and though she didn't know the rest, she knew they were important, and once she heard them, she knew she would never forget them.  "For Your great glowing son who lights the day, and Your fair shining mate who guards the night, we have come to honor You. ror Your life-giving birth waters that fill the rivers and seas and rain down from the skies, we have come to honor You. For Your Gift of Life ao" Your blessing of women to bring forth life as You do, we have cooic" honor You.

A second fire was kindled from a the first in the Ceremonial Hearth; then the One Who Served k Mother stood between the two areas of glowing names and spoke "Most people who have not seen it do not believe that stones unii burn, unless we have one to show, but burning stones are the Cnw.

"Jondalar has a Future Claim on me, and that's what he asked for--not that it's much of a claim. We'd give them food and supplies anyway." There was a refrain of agreement from the gathering.  j;ifj Jondalar knew that the Losadunai would have given them food, just | as Ayla and he would have given the Cave a firestone, but he didn't want them to feel sorry later about giving up food supplies that could I i leave them stretched thin if spring and the new growing season came j^ late. He wanted them to feel they were getting the best of a good ^ bargain, and he wanted something else. He stood up then.  |il "We have given Losaduna a firestone for everyone's use," he said, :ff "but there is more to my claim than it seems. We need more than food Jj ( and supplies for ourselves. We don't travel alone. Our companions are j li two horses and a wolf, and we need help to get them across the ice.  jjj i: We will need food for ourselves, and for them, but even more impor- t tant, we will need water. If it were just Ayla and me, we could wear a | waterbag full of snow or ice under our tunics next to our skin to melt enough water for us, and maybe for Wolf, but horses drink a lot of | tl water. We can't melt enough for them that way. I will tell you the '' I truth; we need to find a way to carry or melt enough water to get us j[ all across the glacier." There was a chorus of voices full of suggestions and ideas, but Laduni quieted them. "Let's think about it and meet tomorrow with suggestions. Tonight is Festival." , Jondalar and Ayla had already brought delicious excitement and mystery to enliven the usually quiet winter months of the Cave, ana to give them stories to tell at Summer Meetings.

He had smiled at her several times, to she had responded by blushing and looking away. He walked her as the gathering was breaking up and leaving the Ceremo- arth.  to Madenia," he said. "What did you think of the firestone?" pit the attraction he often had for shy young women before their ites, who didn't know what to expect and were a little afraid, |ly those he had been called upon to introduce to the Mother's ' Pleasures. He had always enjoyed showing them Her Gift their First Rites, and he had a special feeling for it, which was ; was called upon so often. Madenia's fear was well grounded, amorphous worries of most young women, and he would have sred it an even greater challenge to bring her around to knowing rather than the pain.  alar looked at her with his amazingly vivid blue eyes, and he they were staying long enough to participate in the Losadunai r rituals. He genuinely wanted to help her to overcome her nd was truly attracted to her, which brought out the full power sharm, his sheer male magnetism. The handsome and sensitive liled at her then and left her nearly breathless.  enia had never experienced a feeling like it before. Her whole bit warm, almost on fire, and she had an overwhelming urge to iim, and to have him touch her, but the young woman had no liat to do with such feelings. She tried to smile; then, embar- she opened her eyes wide and gasped at her audacity. She away and almost ran to her dwelling space. Her mother saw ving and followed after her. Jondalar had seen Madenia's reac- fore. It was not unusual for shy young women to respond to it way, and it only made her more endearing.  at did you do to that poor child, Jondalar?" ooked at the woman who had spoken, and turned his smile on need I ask?

It was too late for Thono- "I heard a cave lion got him. I'm sorry." Jondalar nodded, and closed his eyes with the inevitable frown ^e pain.  "Mother?" a girl said. It was Thonolia, holding hands with Sol dia's eldest daughter. "Can I eat at 'Salia's hearth and play with i-k> wolf? He likes children, you know." Filonia looked at Jondalar with an apprehensive frown.  "Wolf won't hurt her. He does like children. Ask Solandia. She uses him to entertain her baby," Jondalar said. "Wolf was raised with chil dren and Ayla has trained him, and you're right. She is a remarkable woman, particularly with animals." "I guess it's all right, Thonolia. I don't think this man would let you do anything that might harm you. He is the brother of the man you're named after." There was a loud commotion. They looked to see what the trouble was, as the girls ran off together.  "When is someone going to do something about that... that Cha- roli? How long does a mother have to wait?" Verdegia complained to Laduni. "Maybe we need to call a Council of Mothers, if the men can't handle it. I'm sure they would understand the feelings in a mother's heart, and pass judgment fast enough." Losaduna had joined Laduni, to lend him support. Calling a Council of Mothers was usually a last resort. It could have serious repercussions and was used only when no other way could be found to solve a problem. "Let's not be hasty, Verdegia. The messenger we sent to talk to Tomasi should be back any time. Certainly you can wait a little longer. And Madenia is much better. Don't you think so?" "I'm not so sure. She ran away to our hearth and won't tell me what's wrong. She says it's nothing, and tells me not to worry about it, but how can I help it?" Verdegia said.  "I could tell her what's wrong," Filonia said under her breath, "but I'm not sure Verdegia would understand. She's right, though. Some thing does have to be done about Charoli. All the Caves are talking about him." "What can be done?" Ayla asked, joining the two.  "I don't know," Filonia said, smiling at the woman. Ayla had come to see her baby and had obviously enjoyed holding him. "But I ttunK Laduni's plan is a good one. He thinks all the Caves should vfor together to find and bring the young men back.

"And they would like you to be there to make a and a claim," he said.  legia was almost appeased, but still not happy about Madenia's reluctance to participate in the ceremony that would officially m l^l her a woman, and, with luck, able to bear children--her potent"^ grandchildren.  "I'll be glad to charge and claim," Verdegia said, "and if she we agree to First Rites, you can be certain I won't forget it." "I am hopeful that by next summer, she will change her mind I d see progress since the cleansing ritual. She is out mingling with neoni more. I think Ayla helped," Losaduna said.  After Rendoli went to his dwelling space, Losaduna caught Tonda- lar's eye and nodded to him. The tall man excused himself and followed Losaduna into the Ceremonial Hearth. Ayla would have liked to follow them, but she sensed from their manner that they wanted to be alone.  "I wonder what they are going to do," Ayla said.  "I would guess it's some kind of personal ritual," Filonia said, which made Ayla even more curious.    "Have you brought something you made?" Losaduna asked.  "I made a blade. I didn't have time to haft it, but it is as perfect as I could make it,"jondalar said, taking a small leather-wrapped package from inside his tunic. He opened it to reveal a small stone point with an unretouched edge that was sharp enough to shave with. One end was worked to a point. The other end had a tang that could be fitted into a knife handle.  Losaduna looked it over carefully. "This is excellent workmanship," he commented. "I feel certain it will be acceptable." Jondalar breathed a sigh of relief, though he hadn't realized he was so concerned.  "And something others?" "That was harder. We have been traveling with only the bare essentials, for the most part, and she knows where she puts everything she has. She has a few things packed away, gifts from people, mostly, and I didn't want to disturb them. Then I remembered that you said it didn't matter how small it was, so long as it was very personal," Jo"' dalar said, picking up a tiny object that was also in the leather P3^^.  then went on to explain. "She wears an amulet, a small decorated pouch with objects from her childhood inside.

The Mother may be so pleased ou, She might even use your spirit, especially if you also honor ell." lalar closed his eyes and nodded, but Losaduna saw his jaw and grind. It was not going to be easy for the man.  e has never taken part in a Festival to Honor the Mother. What . doesn't want anyone else?" Jondalar asked. "Should I refuse u must encourage her to share with others, but the choice is, of , hers. You must never refuse any woman, if you can help it, at estival, but especially not the one you have chosen to be your I wouldn't worry about it, Jondalar. Most women get into the  spirit of it and have no trouble enjoying the Mother Festival " I duna said. "But it is strange that Ay la wasn't raised to know th Mother. I didn't know there were any people who don't acknowled Her." ge "The people who raised her were... unusual in many ways " Ton dalar said.  "I'm sure that's true," Losaduna said. "Now, let's go ask the Mother." Ask the Mother. Ask the Mother. The phrase went through Tonda- lar's thoughts as they walked toward the back of the ceremonial space He suddenly remembered being told that he was favored by the Mother, so favored that no woman could refuse him, not even Doni Herself; so favored that if he ever asked the Mother for anything, She would grant his request. He had also been warned to be wary of such favor; he might get what he asked for. At that moment, he fervently hoped it was true.  They stopped at the niche where the lamp still burned. "Pick the dunai up and hold her in your hands," the One Who Served the Mother instructed.  Jondalar reached into the niche and gently picked up the Mother figure. It was one of the most beautifully made carvings he had ever seen. Her body was perfectly shaped. The figure in his hand looked as if the sculptor had carved it from a living model of a well-proportioned woman who was quite substantial in size. He had seen naked women often enough, in the normal course of living in close quarters, to know how one looked. The arms, resting on top of the ample breasts of the figure, were only suggested, but even so, fingers were defined, as well as the bracelets on her forearms. Her two legs came together into a kind of peg that went into the ground.  The head was most surprising. Most of the donii he had seen had hardly more than a knob for the head, sometimes with a face denned by the hairline but no features. This one had an elaborate hairstyle of rows of tight knobby curls that went all the way around the head and face. Except for the difference in shape, there was no difference be tween the back and the front of the head.  When he looked closely, he was surprised to see that it had been carved out of limestone. Ivory or bone or wood were much easier work, and the figure was so perfectly detailed and beautifully in^ that it was hard to believe someone had made her out of stone. Many flint tools must have been dulled to make this, he thought.  The One Who Served the Mother had been chanting, Jondalar real^ ized. He had been so involved in studying the donii that he ba J it at first, but he had learned enough Losadunai that when he d carefully, he understood some of the names of the Mother, knew that Losaduna had started the ritual. He waited, hoping jreciation of the material aesthetic qualities of the carving would stract from the greater spiritual essence of the ceremony. Al- l the donii was a symbol for the Mother and, it was thought, 1 a resting place for one of Her many spirit forms, he knew the | figure was not the Great Earth Mother.  W, think about it clearly, and in your own words, from your ask the Mother for what you want," Losaduna said. "Holding inai will help you to concentrate all your thoughts and feelings aw request.

I'd like to ask her, but this is a private ritual. I can't tell her what he has said here. Maybe we can discuss it from a nh'l^l sophical point of view sometime.    Ayla watched the two men leave the Ceremonial Hearth. She f sure they both had accomplished what they meant to do but tk.  shorter man had a questioning expression and an unsatisfied set to h' shoulders, and the tall one had stiffened and looked rather unhann but determined. The strange undercurrent made her even more cnri ous about what went on inside.  "I hope she will change her mind," Losaduna was saying as they drew near. "I think the best way for her to overcome her terrible experience is to go ahead with her First Rites. We will have to be very careful who we choose for her, though. I wish you were stavim?  Jondalar. She seems to have developed an interest in you. I think it's good to see her warming toward a man." "I would like to help, but we just can't stay. We have to leave as soon as we can, tomorrow or the next day, if possible." "You're right, of course. The season could turn any time. Be wary if you notice either one of you getting irritable," Losaduna said.  "The Malaise," Jondalar said.  "What is Malaise?" Ayla asked.  "It comes with the foehn, the snow-melter, the spring wind," Losaduna said. "The wind comes out of the southwest, warm and dry, and hard enough to uproot trees. It melts snow so fast that high drifts can be gone in a day, and if it hits when you are on the glacier, you may not make it across. The ice could melt beneath your feet and drop you into a crevasse, or it could send a river across your path, or open a crack in front of you. It comes so fast that the evil spirits that like the cold can't get out of its way. It cleans them out, sweeps them out of hidden places, pushes them on ahead. That's why the evil spirits nde the headwinds of the snow-melter and usually arrive just before it.  They bring the Malaise. If you know what to expect and can control them, they can be a warning, but they're subtle, and it's not easy to turn the evil spirits to your advantage." "How do you know when the evil spirits have come?" Ayla asked.  "As I mentioned, watch out if you start feeling irritable. They car make you sick, and if you are already sick, they can make it worse, more often they just make you want to argue or fight. Some people g" into a rage, but everyone knows that it's caused by the Malaise, an people are not held to blame--unless they do serious damage orln)1117.  and even then much is excused.

Everyone could hardly wait for fib greens of spring.  |he hard cold winter was still upon them, and as much as he ('for spring, Jondalar wished even more for the winter to last a tager, just until they got across the glacier that still lay beyond  A kfter the meal Losaduna announced that something was beiiw offered at the Ceremonial Hearth. Ayla and Jondalar didn't understand the word, but they soon learned it was a drink that was served warm The taste was pleasant and vaguely familiar. Ayla thought it might be some kind of mildly fermented fruit juice flavored with herbs.. She was surprised to learn from Solandia that birch sap was a primanf ingredient, though fruit juice was only part of the recipe.  It turned out that the taste was deceiving. The drink was stronger than Ayla had thought, and when she asked, Solandia confided that the herbs contributed a large measure of its potency. Then Ayla realized that the vaguely familiar taste came from wormwood artemisia, a very powerful herb that could be dangerous if too much was taken, or if it was used too frequently. It had been difficult to detect because of the pleasant-tasting but highly perfumed woodruff and other aromatic flavors. It made her wonder what else was in it, which led her to taste and analyze the drink more seriously.  She asked Solandia about the powerful herb, mentioning its possible dangers. The woman explained that the plant, which she called absinthe, was seldom used except in that drink, reserved only for Mother Festivals. Because of its sacred nature, Solandia was usually reluctant to reveal the specific ingredients in the drink, but Ayla's questions were so precise and knowledgeable that she couldn't help but answer.  Ayla discovered that the beverage was not at all what it seemed. What she had first thought to be a simple, pleasant-tasting, mild drink was in fact a potent, complex mixture made especially to encourage the relaxation, spontaneity, and warm interaction that were desirable during the Festival to Honor the Mother.  As the people of the Cave began coming into the Ceremonial Hearth, Ayla first noticed a heightened awareness as a result of all her tasting, but it soon gave way to a pleasant, languorous, warm feeling that ma her forget about analyzing. She noticed Jondalar and several other, talking to Madenia, and, abruptly leaving Solandia, she headed towa them. Every man there saw her coming and liked what he saw.  j as she approached the group, and Jondalar felt the powerful ier smile always evoked. It was not going to be easy to follow [una's instructions and encourage her to experience the Mother ral fully» even with the relaxing drink that the One Who Served [other had urged on him.

When he took md to lead her to the dancing area, she felt a tingling of chills and it the same time, and she could not have resisted even if she had Mlia frowned for a moment, but then smiled at the girl. "We can teach him the steps," she said, leading them to the dancing area.  ay I show..." Daraldi started to say to Ayla, just as Laduni "I would be happy..." They smiled at each other, trying to ach other a chance to speak.  la's smile took them both in. "Perhaps both of you could show e steps," she said.  1'aldi bobbed his head in agreement, and Laduni gave her a happy is they each took one of her hands and led her toward the where the dancers were gathering. While they were arranging  themselves in a circle, the visitors were shown some basic steos- rk ^ they all joined hands as a flute sounded. Ayla was startled h'v ?  sound. She hadn't heard a flute since Manen's playing at the Sum Meeting of the Mamutoi. Had it been less than a year since they 1 ^ the Meeting? It seemed so long ago, and she would never see th again.  She blinked away tears at the thought, but as the dancing began sh had little time to dwell on poignant reminiscences. The rhythm'wa easy to follow in the beginning, but became faster and more comnley as the evening progressed. Ayla was unquestionably the center of attention.  Every man found her irresistible. They crowded around her vying for her attention, making innuendos and even blatant invitations thinly veiled as jokes. Jondalar flirted gently with Madenia and more obviously with Filonia, but he was aware of every man circling around Ayla.  The dancing became more complicated, with intricate steps and changing of places, and Ayla danced with them all. She laughed at their jokes and bawdy remarks as people broke away to refill their cups, or couples retreated to secluded corners. Laduni jumped into the middle and did an energetic solo performance. Toward the end, his mate joined him.  Ayla was feeling thirsty, and several people went with her to get another drink. She found Daraldi walking beside her.  "I would like some, too," Madenia said.  "I'm sorry," Losaduna said, putting his hand over her cup. "You have not had your Rites of First Pleasures, yet, my dear. You will have to settle for tea." Madenia frowned and started to object; then she went to get a cup of the innocuous beverage she had been drinking.  He did not intend to allow her any of the privileges of womanhood until she went through the ceremony that bestowed womanhood, and he was doing everything he could to encourage her to agree to the important ritual. At the same time, he was letting everyone know that in spite of her terrible experience, she had been purified, restored to her former state, and was to be subject to the same restrictions and treated with the same special care and attention given to any other girl on the verge of becoming a woman. He felt it was the only way she would ever fully recover from the unconscionable attack and rnultip e rape she had suffered.  Ayla and Daraldi were the last to drink, and as everyone else wandered away in one direction or the other, they were left alone.  turned to her.

She had onded; he could wait a little longer.  hen they reached the central area, Ayla noticed that Jondalar was there. He was dancing with Madenia, holding both her hands and ^ing her a step he had learned from the Sharamudoi. Filonia,  Losaduna, Solandia, and a few others were clapping their nearby; the flute player and the one beating the rhythms had fiT^ partners. ^1 Ayla and Daraldi joined in clapping their hands together. She caiiok.  Jondalar's eye and changed from slapping both hands together to sl SS ping her thighs, in the Mamutoi style.

Soon they were moving together, then backing away ar5 around each other, looking at each other over their shoulders. When they came face-to-face, they reached for each other's hands. From thr moment she caught his eye, Ayla saw no one but Jondalar. The een.  eralized warmth and friendliness she had felt for Daraldi was lost in her overpowering response to the desire, the need, and the love in the blue, blue eyes looking at her at that moment.  The intensity between them was apparent to everyone. Losaduna watched them closely for a while, then nodded imperceptibly. It was clear that the Mother was making Her wishes known. Daraldi shrugged his shoulders, then smiled at Filonia. Madenia's eyes opened wide. She knew she was seeing something rare and beautiful.  When Ayla and Jondalar stopped dancing, they were in each other's arms oblivious to everyone around them. Solandia started clapping and soon all of those who were left joined in the applause. The sound finally reached them. They backed away from each other, feeling a bit self-conscious.  "I think there is still a drink or two left," Solandia said. "Shall we finish it off?" "That's a good idea!" Jondalar said, his arm around Ayla. He wasn't about to let her go now.  Daraldi picked up the large wooden bowl to pour out the last of the special drink, then looked at Filonia. I'm really very lucky, he thought.  She is a beautiful woman, and she has brought two children to my hearth. Just because it was Mother Festival didn't mean he had to honor Her with someone other than his mate.  Jondalar finished his drink in one swallow, put his cup down, then suddenly picked Ayla up and carried her to their bed. She re strangely giddy, full of joy, almost as though she had escaped some unpleasant fate, but her joy was nothing to Jondalar's. He had watch her all night, seen the way all the men wanted her, tried to give b every opportunity as Losaduna had advised, and was sure she we end up choosing someone else.  He could have gone with someone else many times himself, bu wouldn't leave until he was sure she was gone. Instead, he staye  a, knowing she was not available to any man yet. He enjoyed attention to her, seeing her relax around him, appreciating the 0gs of the woman she was going to be. Although he wouldn't anied Filonia if she had gone with someone else, and she had (pportunities, he was glad she'd stayed near him. He would ited being left alone if Ayla had chosen someone else.

The hot springs had never slowed wn for very long. It just gave him a little extra measure of sometimes. But Losaduna was not the only one watching them Iren were never excluded from Mother Festivals. They learned s and activities they were expected to know as adults by watch- Its. When they played games, they often mimicked their elders, ore they were actually capable of any serious sexual acts, boys i on girls in imitation of their fathers, and girls pretended to th to dolls in imitation of their mothers. Soon after they were , they passed into adulthood with rituals that not only brought  them adult status but adult responsibilities, although they didn't essarily choose a mate for several years. Babies were born in their llwy time, when the Mother chose to bless a woman, but surprisinelv w seldom born to very young women. All babies were welcomed ported, and cared for by the extended family and close friend's tl^ made up a Cave.  Madenia had observed Mother Festivals as long as she could remwn- her , but this time it took on new meaning. She had watched several nf the couples--it did not seem to hurt anyone, not the way she had befn hurt, even when some of the women chose several men--but she wa particularly interested in Ayla and Jondalar. As soon as they left the cave, she put on her parka and followed them.  They found their way to the double-walled tent and went into the second enclosure, welcoming the steamy warmth. They stood just inside, looked around, then put the lamp down on the raised earth altar. They took off their outer parkas and sat down on the felted wool pads that covered the ground.  Jondalar began by taking off Ayla's boots; then he removed his own.  He kissed her long and lovingly, while he undid the fastenings on her tunic and undergarment, and pulled them up over her head, then bent down to kiss each nipple. He untied her fur-lined leggings and breech- cloutlike underwear and pulled them off, stopping to caress her mound covered with soft hair--they hadn't bothered to put on their outer leggings with the fur facing out. Then he undressed himself and took her in his arms, delighting in the feel of her skin next to his, and wanted her that instant.  He led her into the steaming pool, they immersed once, then went to the washing area. Jondalar scooped out a handful of soft soap from the bowl and began rubbing it over Ayla's back and her twin mounds, avoiding her enticingly warm, moist places for the moment. It was smooth and slippery, and he loved the way it felt on her skin. Ayla closed her eyes, felt his hands caress her in the way he knew best to please her, and gave herself over to his wonderfully smooth touch, feeling every tingling sensation.  He took another handful and smoothed it on her legs, lifting eac foot and feeling her slight spasm at the tickling of the bottom of her feet. Then he turned her around and faced her front, but took time w kiss her, gently and slowly exploring her lips and her tongue, tee i"g her response. His own response had swelled, and his manhood see to move of its own volition, striving to reach her.  With another small handful of soap, he started under her araw caressing with the delightful slippery foam down to her nil  ,, feeling her nipples harden under his palms.

Then he picked up the r bowl, filled it with water from the hot pool, and began pouring her. He poured several more bowlfuls over her before he led ck into the hot water.  ;y sat on the stone seats and held each other close, pressing warm rainst warm skin, and dunking under until only their heads were the water. Then, taking her hand, Jondalar led Ayla out of the once more. He laid her down on the soft mats, and just looked for a while, glowing and wet, and waiting for him.  her surprise, he spread her thighs first and ran his tongue the full ; of her folds. He tasted no salt, and her special taste was gone; it new experience, to taste her without tasting her, but as he i in the novelty of it, he heard her begin to moan and cry out.

He moved lower and found her nipple.

His spent manhood was swelling again, and  w when she felt it, she abruptly sat up and bent down to take it into k ^ mouth and help it along. He lay back to enjoy the sensations she coursing through him, as she took in as much as she could sucr hard, then releasing and letting it slide back. She found the hard rid^ on the underside and rubbed her tongue across it rapidly; then pulli back the foreskin a little, she circled the smooth head with her ton" faster and faster. He moaned with the fiery waves coursing throuoh him, then pulled her around until she straddled him, and he reached up to taste the warm petal of her flower.  At almost the same moment, they felt themselves and each other mount and mount, and when he tasted her again, he pulled himself back, turned her around so that she was on her knees, guided himself in, and felt her full, deep well again. She pushed back with each stroke, rocking, moving, plunging in and pulling back, feeliiw every push, every pull, and then, it came again, first she and, at the next stroke, he felt the marvelous surge of the Mother's great Gift of Pleasure.  They both collapsed, exhausted, pleasurably, wonderfully, languorously exhausted. They felt a draft for a moment, but didn't move, and they even dozed off for a time. When they woke, they got up and washed again, then soaked in the hot waters. To their surprise, when they got out, they found clean, dry, velvety soft leather blankets to dry themselves with beside the entrance.    Madenia walked back to the cave, experiencing feelings she had never known before. She had been moved by Jondalar's intense but controlled passion and his caring tenderness, and by Ay la's eager response and unreserved willingness to abandon herself to him, to trust him completely. Their experience was not at all like the one she had endured. Their Pleasures had been fiery and physical but not brutal; it was not taking from one to serve the other's lust, but giving and sharing to please and gratify each other. Ayla had told her the truth; the Mother's Pleasures could be an exciting, sensual delight, a joyful and pleasurable celebration of their love.  And though she didn't quite know what to do about it, she was aroused, physically and emotionally. She had tears in her eyes. At tba moment, she wanted Jondalar. She wished he could be the one to share her womanhood rites, though she knew that wasn't possible. But s e decided, at that moment, that if she could have someone like him. s e would agree to go through with the ceremony and have her Ki e First Pleasures at the next Summer Meeting.  ne was feeling particularly lively the next morning. Ayla made )rning-after" drink she had developed for the after-celebration ies at the Lion Camp, though she only had enough ingredients people of the Ceremonial Hearth. She carefully checked her of the contraceptive tea she took each morning, and decided it last until the growing season when she could collect more.  itely it wasn't necessary to take much.  snia came to see the visitors before noon. Smiling shyly at Jon- he announced that she had decided to have her First Rites.  t's wonderful, Madenia. You won't be sorry," the tall, hand- vonderfully gentle man said. She looked up at him with such eyes that he bent down and kissed her cheek, then nuzzled her d breathed in her ear. He stood up and smiled at her, and she [ in his remarkable blue eyes. Her heart was beating so fast that Id hardly breathe. At that moment, more than anything, Ma- dshed that Jondalar could be the one who would be chosen for es of First Pleasures. Then she felt embarrassed, afraid, that w he knew what she was thinking. Suddenly she ran out of the irea.  bad we don't live closer to the Losadunai," he said, watching "I would like to help that young woman, but I'm sure they'll neone." , I'm sure they will, but I hope she hasn't built up her expecta- o high.

"We've been traveling alone r for so long that... I've never really said it before, but... I ttle... I don't know... reluctant, I guess, to be as impetu-  ous, as free when we're around people. I thought we were alone la, night. If I'd known she was there, I might not have been as... unr- strained," he said.  Ayla smiled. "I know," she said. She was becoming more and mon, aware that he didn't like to reveal the deeply sensitive side of hj( nature, and she was pleased that he would express himself to her in words and actions. "I'm glad you didn't know she was there, both for me, and for her." "Why for her?" he asked.  "I think that's what convinced her to go ahead with her womanhood ceremony. She had been around men and women sharing Pleasures often enough that she didn't think about it, until those men forced her Afterward she could only think about the pain, and the horror of being used as a thing, with no thought for her as a woman. It's hard to explain, Jondalar. Something like that makes you feel so... terrible." "I'm sure that's true, but I think there was more to it," the man said.  "After a girl has her first moon time, but before she has had her First Rites, a woman is most vulnerable--and most desirable. Every man is drawn to her, perhaps because she may not be touched. At any other time, a woman is free to choose any man, or none, but at that time, it is dangerous for her." "Like Latie wasn't even supposed to look at her brothers," Ayla said.  "Mamut explained about that." "Maybe not entirely," Jondalar said. "It is up to the girl-woman to show restraint then, and it's not always easy. She is the center of attention; every man wants her, particularly the younger ones, and it can be hard for her to resist. They follow her around, trying every way they can to get her to give in to them. Some girls do, especially those who have a long wait before the Summer Meeting. But if she allows herself to be opened without the proper rituals, she is.  not well thought of. If it's found out, and sometimes the Mother blesses her before she is a woman, making sure everyone knows that she was opened--people can be cruel. They blame her and make fun other." "But why should they blame her? They should blame the men who won't let her alone," Ayla said, irked at the unfairness.  "People say if she can't show restraint, she lacks the qualities to assume the responsibilities of Motherhood and Leadership. She will never be chosen to sit on the Council of Mothers, or Sisters, or whatever name her people give to their council of highest authority, so she loses status, which makes her less desirable as a mate. Not that she loses the status of her mother or her hearth--nothing she is born with  gi away--but she will never be chosen by a man of high status, 0 one who has the potential for it. I think Madenia feared that as as anything," Jondalar said.  i wonder Verdegia said she was ruined." Ay la's brow creased Kconcem. "Jondalar, will her people accept Losaduna's cleansing H7 You know that once she is open, she can never really go back to |ray she was." think so. It wasn't that she didn't show restraint.

"That's a id idea," she said.  But Laduni's right, it will be a heavy load," Laronia added.  Then we'll have to go through our things and get rid of everything can," Jondalar said. "We won't need much. Once we get across, II be close to Dalanar's Camp." they were already down to bare necessities. How much more could Y get rid of? Ay la thought as the meeting broke up. Madenia fell in lue her as she walked back to their sleeping place. The girl-woman 1 not only developed a strong crush on Jondalar, but a bit of hero- ^hip toward Ayla, which made Ayla a little uncomfortable. But "ked Madenia and asked her if she would like to sit with her while sorted through her things.  " Ayla began unpacking and spreading out her belongings, she  tried to remember how many times she had done this before o.ijBI Journey. It would be difficult to make choices. Everything had ^at meaning to her, but if they were going to get across this fonnid^ glacier that Jondalar had been worrying about from the berinn" with Whinney and Racer, and Wolf, she had to eliminate as much.  possible.  The first package she opened contained the beautiful outfit made of soft chamois that Roshario had given to her. She held it up, then SDread it out in front of her.  "Oooh! How beautiful! The patterns that are sewn on, and the way it's cut, I've never seen anything like it," Madenia said, unable to resist reaching out to touch it. "And so soft! I have never felt anything so soft." "It was given to me by a woman of the Sharamudoi, people who live far away from here, near the end of the Great Mother River, where she is truly a great river. You wouldn't believe how big the Mother River gets. The Sharamudoi are really two people. The Shamudoi live on the land and hunt chamois. Do you know that animal?" Ayla asked.  Madenia shook her head. "It is a mountain animal, something like an ibex, but smaller." "Yes, I do know that, but we call it by a different name," Madenia said.  "The Ramudoi are River People and hunt the great sturgeon--mat's a huge fish. Together, they have a special way of curing the hides of the chamois to make them soft and supple like this." Ayla picked up the embroidered tunic and thought about the Sharamudoi people she had met. It seemed so long ago. She could have lived with them; she still felt the same way, and she knew she would never see them again. She hated the thought of leaving the gift from Roshario behind. Then she looked into Madenia's shining eyes as she admired it, and Ayla made a decision.  "Would you like to have this, Madenia?" Madenia jerked her hands back as though she had touched something hot. "I couldn't! It was a gift to you," she said.  "We have to lighten our load. I think Roshario would be pleased if you would accept it, since you love it so. It was meant to be a matrimonial outfit, but I already have one." "Are you sure?" Madenia said.  Ayla could see her eyes glistening, incredulous at the thought o such a beautiful, exotic outfit. "Yes, I'm sure. You might consider it for your Matrimonial, if it is appropriate. Think of it as a giit remember me."  »n't need a gift to remember you," Madenia said, her eyes brim- with tears. "I will never forget you.

She died on their way back, so he returned with only the he man's sister raised him." enia gave a little shiver of excitement. She thought the only  thing south was the mountains, and that they went on forever. Av]a had traveled so far and knew so much. Maybe someday she would make a Journey like Ayla, and meet a brown man who would carve a beautiful horse for her, and people who would give her beautiful clothes, and find horses that would let her ride them, and a wolf that loved children, and a man likejondalar, who would ride the horses and make the long Journey with her. Madenia was lost in daydreams of great adventure.  She had never met anyone like Ayla. She idolized the beautiful woman who led such an exciting life, and she hoped she might be like her in some way. Ayla spoke with a strange accent, but that or»ly added to her mystery, and hadn't she suffered a forced attack by a man when she was a girl, too? Ayla had gotten over it but understood how someone else felt. In the warmth, love, and understanding of the people around her, Madenia was beginning to recover from the horror of the incident. She began to imagine herself, mature and wise, telling some young girl, who had suffered such an attack, about her experience, to help her overcome it.  While Madenia daydreamed, she watched Ayla pick up a neatly tied package. The woman held it but didn't open it; she knew exactly what was inside it, and she had no intention of leaving it behind.  "What's that?" the girl asked, as Ayla put it aside.  Ayla picked it up again; she hadn't seen it herself for some time. She looked around to make sure Jondalar was not in sight, then untied the knots. Inside was a pure white tunic decorated with ermine tails. Madenia's eyes became big and round.  "That's as white as snow! I've never seen any leather colored white like that," she said.  "Making white leather is a secret of the Crane Hearth. I learned how to make it from an old woman, who learned it from her mother," Ayla explained. "She had no one to pass the knowledge down to, so when I asked her to teach me, she agreed." "You made that?" Madenia said.  "Yes. For Jondalar, but he doesn't know it. I'm going to give it to him when we reach his home, I think for our Matrimonial," Ayla said.  When she held it up, a package fell out if it, too. Madenia could see it was a man's tunic. Except for the ermine tails, there were no decorations; no embroidered patterns or designs, no shells or beads, but it needed none. Decorations would have detracted. In its simplicity, the pure whiteness of the color made it stunning.  Ayla opened the smaller package. Inside was the strange figure or 3 woman with a carved face. If she hadn't just seen wonder after wonder' old have frightened the girl; dunai never had faces. But somehow 5 all right for Ay la to have one.  mdalar made this for me," Ayla said. "He told me he made it to are my spirit, and for my womanhood ceremony, the first time he it me the Mother's Gift of Pleasure. There was no one else to ; in it, but we didn't need it. Jondalar made it a ceremony. Later [ye this to me to keep because it has great power, he says." believe it," Madenia said. She had no desire to touch it, but she t doubt that Ayla could control any power it held.  da sensed her uneasiness and wrapped the figure back up again.  .Ticked it inside the carefully folded white tunic and wrapped that e fine, thin sewn-together rabbit hides that protected it, then tied [h the cords.  lother wrapped package held some of the gifts she had received at doption ceremony, when she was accepted into the Mamutoi.

She id over her bowls and cooking implements and eliminated all but bsolute essentials. She would have to wait for Jondalar to decide t the tents, ropes, and other gear.  st as she and Madenia were about to go out, Jondalar came into welling space. He and several others had just returned with a load own coal, and he had come in to sort through his things. Several people came in then, too, including Solandia and her children Wolf.  we really come to depend on this animal, and I'm going to miss I don't suppose you'd like to leave him," she said.  r signaled Wolf.

But she was still young and, as they waved tears streamed down her face.  "I will never forget you, either of you," she called out, then ran into the cave.  As they rode away, back toward the Great Mother River, which was hardly more than a stream, Ay la thought she would never forget Ma denia, or her people either. Jondalar was sorry to say goodbye, too but his thoughts were on the difficulties they had yet to face. He knew the toughest part of their Journey still lay ahead. ^ondalar and Ayla headed north, back toward Donau, the Great Idler River that had guided their steps for so much of their Journey.  |en they reached her, they turned west again and continued to low the stream back toward her beginnings, but the great waterway I changed character. She was no longer a huge meandering surge Bng with ponderous dignity across the flat plains, taking in countless butanes and volumes of silt, then breaking into channels and form- r oxbow lakes.  Near her source, she was fresher, sprightlier, a leaner, shallower |am that tumbled over her wide rocky bed as she raced down the |p mountainside. But the westward route of the travelers along the tfUy flowing river had become a continuous uphill climb, one that & them ever closer to their inevitable rendezvous with the thick layer nmelting ice that capped the broad high plateau of the rugged land ahead.  tie shapes of glaciers followed the contours of the land. Those on ntaintops were craggy tors of ice, those on level ground spread out ; pancakes, with a nearly uniform thickness, rising slightly higher (he middle, leaving behind gravel banks and gouging out depressions tt became lakes and ponds. At its farthest advance, the southernmost te of the vast continental cake of ice, whose nearly level top was as p as the mountains around them, missed by less than five degrees latitude a meeting with the northern reaches of the mountain gla- |S. The land between the two was the coldest anywhere on earth.  pnlike mountain glaciers, frozen rivers creeping slowly down the es of mountains, the unmelting ice on the rounded, nearly flat high- "--the glacier Jondalar was so concerned about still to the west of Ito--was a plateau glacier, a miniature version of the great thick -r of ice that spread across the plains of the continent to the north.  " Ayla and Jondalar continued along the river, they gained altitude "each step. They made the ascent with an eye toward sparing the ^uy laden horses, most often leading them instead of riding. Ayla was particularly concerned for Whinney, who was hauling the ma' portion of the burning stones that they hoped would ensure the si r vival of their traveling companions when they crossed the icy surfa a terrain that horses would never attempt on their own. ' In addition to Whinney's pole drag, both horses carried heavy packs though the load on the mare's back was lighter, to compensate for th' travois she pulled. Racer's load was piled so high that it was somewhat unwieldy, but even the backpacks of the woman and man were substantial.  Only the wolf was free of additional burdens, and Ay la had begun to eye his unfettered movements, thinking that he, too could carry a share.  "All this effort to carry rocks," Ayla remarked one morning as she shrugged on her backpack. "Some people would think we were strange to be hauling this heavy load of stones up these mountains." "Many more think we're strange for traveling with two horses and a wolf," Jondalar countered, "but if we're going to get them across the ice, we're going to have to get these stones up there. And there is one thing to be glad for." "What is that?" "How easy it will be once we reach the other side." The upper course of the river traversed the northern foreland of the range of mountains to the south, which was so huge that the travelers had little real sense of its immense scale. The Losadunai lived in a region, just south of the river, of more rounded, massiflike limestone mountains with extensive areas of relatively level plateaus. Though worn down by eons of wind and water, the eroded eminences were lofty enough to bear glistening crowns of ice throughout the year.  Between the river and the mountains was a landscape of dormant vegetation overlaying a flysch zone of sandstone. This in turn was covered by a light mantle of winter snow that blurred the lower boundary of the unmelting ice, but the shimmer of glacial blue revealed its nature.  Farther south, gleaming in the sun like giant shards of broken alabaster, the exalted crags of the central zone, almost a separate range within the great mass of uplifted earth, soared high above the nearer heights. As the travelers continued their climb toward the higher western chain within the complex range, the silent march of the centra mountains followed their progression, watched over by a brooding p311" of jagged peaks towering far above the rest.  To the north, across the river, the ancient crystalline massif r05 steeply, its undulating surface occasionally overtopped by rocky crsg3 and covered by block fields with raised meadows in between. Looki f> westward, higher rounded hills, some topped with small icy ; of their own, reached across the frozen river, no boundary to s join the ice of the younger folded ridges of the southern range.  powdery snow drifted down less frequently as their Journey icin closer to the coldest part of the continent, the region be- the farthest northern extension of the mountain glacier and the nmost reaches of the vast, continent-spanning ice sheets. Not ie windy loess steppes of the eastern plains could match the v of its bitter cold. The land was saved from the desolation of ice sheets only by the moderating maritime influence of the i ocean.  highland glacier they planned to go over, without the air d by the unfrozen ocean keeping the encroaching ice at bay, lave expanded and become impossible to cross. The maritime ces that allowed passage to the western steppes and tundras also ie glaciers away from the land of the Zeiandonii, sparing it the layer of ice that covered other lands at the same latitude.    alar and Ayla fell easily back into their traveling routine, al- it seemed to Ayla that they had been traveling forever. She to reach the end of their Journey. Memories of the quiet winter earthlodge of the Lion Camp flashed into her mind as they d forward through the monotony of the winter landscape. She i small incidents with pleasure, forgetting the misery that had idowed her days the whole time when she'd thought that Jon- ad stopped loving her.  ough all their water had to be melted, usually from river ice than snow--the land was bleak and barren with few snowdrifts i decided there were some benefits to the freezing cold. The ties to the Great Mother River were smaller, and frozen solid, ; them easier to cross. But they invariably hurried across the ank openings because of the fierce winds that roared through of the rivers and streams. These blasts funneled frigid air from h-pressure areas of the southern mountains, adding wind chill ilready freezing air.  ering even in her heavy furs, Ayla felt relieved when they finally t: across a wide valley to the protective barrier of nearby higher "I'm so cold!" she said through chattering teeth. "I wish it warm up a little." alar looked alarmed. "Don't wish that, Ayla!" y not?" have to be across the glacier before the weather turns. A warm  I wind means the foehn, the snow-melter, that will break the seas Then we'll have to go around to the north, through Clan country I will take much longer, and with all the trouble Charoli has been cai ing them, I don't think they will be very welcoming," Jondalar said She nodded with understanding, looking across to the north side nf the river. After studying it for some distance, Ayla said, "They have the better side." "What makes you say that?" "Even from here you can see that there are plains that have good grass, and that would bring more animals to hunt. On this side are mostly scrub pines--that means sandy earth and poor grass, except for a few places. This side must be just enough closer to the ice to be colder, and less rich," she explained.  "You may be right," Jondalar said, thinking her evaluation was astute.  "I don't know what it's like in summer; I've only been here in winter." Ayla had judged accurately. The soils of the northern plains of the valley of the great river were primarily loess over a limestone bedrock, and more fertile than the southern side. In addition, the mountain glaciers of the south crowded closer, making the winters more harsh and the summers cooler, barely warm enough to melt the accumulated snows and ground frost of winter back to the previous summer's snow line--almost. Most of the glaciers were growing again, slowly, but enough to signal a shift from the current milieu, the slightly warmer interval, back to colder times, and one last glacial advance before the long melt that would leave ice only in polar regions.  The dormant state of the trees often left Ayla unsure of their variety, until she tasted a twig tip or bud or bit of inner bark. Where alder dominated near the river, and along the lower valleys of its tributaries, she knew they would be in peaty fen woods if it were summer; where it was mixed with willow and poplar would be the wettest parts, and the occasional ash, elm, or hornbeam, hardly more than woody brush, indicated drier ground. The rare dwarfed oak, struggling to survive in more protected niches, barely hinted at the massive oak forests that would one day cover a more temperate land. Trees were absent entirely from the sandy soils of the raised heath land, able to nourish only heather, whins, sparse grasses, mosses, and lichens.  Even in the frigid climate, some birds and animals thrived; co adapted animals of the steppes and mountains abounded, and hunti g was easy. Only rarely did they use the supplies given to them by t Losadunai, which they wanted to save for the crossing anyway. JN until they reached the frozen wasteland would they need to rely tirely on the resources they carried. J la saw an uncommon pygmy snow owl and pointed it out to |ar. He became adept at finding willow grouse, which tasted like bite-feathered ptarmigan that he had grown so fond of, particu- fae way that Ay la cooked them. Its mixed coloration gave it better iflage in a landscape not entirely covered by snow. Jondalar d to recall that there had been more snow the last time he had that way.  e region was influenced by both the continental east and the ime west, revealed by the unusual mixture of plants and animals eldom lived near each other. The small furry creatures were an ?le that Ay la noticed, although during the freezing season, the dormice, voles, susliks, and hamsters were seldom seen, except she broke through a nest for the vegetable foods they had stored.  gh she sometimes took the animals too, for Wolf or, particularly found giant hamsters, for themselves, the little animals more lonly gave sustenance to martens, foxes, and the small wildcats.  the high plains and along river valleys, they often sighted woolly noths, usually in herds of related females, with an occasional traveling along for company, though in the cold season groups of often banded together. Rhinoceroses were invariably loners, ex- For females with one or two immature young. In the warmer is, bison, aurochs, and every variety of deer, from the giant xros to small shy roe deer, were numerous, but only reindeer i on in winter. Instead mouflon, chamois, and ibex had migrated from their high summer habitat, and Jondalar had never seen so musk-oxen.  eemed to be a year when the musk-ox population was at a high in its cycle. Next year they would probably crash down to min- i numbers, but in the meantime, Ayla and Jondalar found the •thrower proving its worth. When threatened, musk-oxen, partic- ' the belligerent males, formed a tight phalanx of lowered horns ', outward from a circle in order to protect the calves and certain es. This behavior was effective against most predators, but not it a spear-thrower.  thout having to get close enough to put themselves in danger from t, break-away charge, Ayla and Jondalar could take their pick of umals standing their ground and aim from a safe distance. It was t too easy, although they had to be accurate and throw hard to sure the spear would penetrate the dense undercoat.  th several varieties of animals to choose from, they didn't often or food, and they frequently left the less choice pieces of meat for carnivores and scavengers. It wasn't a matter of waste but of Their high-protein diet of lean meat often left them less than satisfied, even when they had eaten their fill. Inner barks, and t I made from the needles and twig tips of trees offered only limited relirf j Omnivorous humans could subsist on a variety of foods, and n teins were essential, but not adequate alone. People had been known to die of protein starvation without, at least, one or the other of veo table produce or fats. Traveling at the end of winter with very little' the way of plant food, they needed fat to survive, but it was so late i the season that the animals they hunted had used most of their own reserves. The travelers selectively took the meat and inner organs that contained the most fat, and left the lean, or gave it to Wolf. He found ample nourishment on his own from the woods and plains along the way.  Another animal did inhabit the region, and though they always noticed them, neither Jondalar nor Ayla could bring themselves to hunt horses. Their fellow travelers fared well enough on the rough dry grass, mosses, lichens, and even small twigs and thin bark.    Ayla and Jondalar traveled west, following the course of the river and angling slightly north, with the massif across the river pacing them. When the river turned somewhat southwest, Jondalar knew they were getting close. The depression between the ancient northern highland and the southern mountains climbed upward toward a wild landscape that outcropped in rugged crags. They passed the place where three streams joined to form the recognizable beginning of the Great Mother River, then crossed over and followed the left bank of the middle course, the Middle Mother. It was the one that Jondalar had been told was considered the true Mother River, though any one of the three could have been.  Reaching what was essentially the beginning of the great river was not the profound experience that Ayla had thought it might be. The Great Mother River didn't spring forth from some clearly denned place, like the great inland sea where she ended. There was no clear beginning, and even the boundary of the northern territory, considered flathead country, was uncertain, but Jondalar had a familiar feeling about the area they were in. He thought they were close to the edge or the actual glacier, though they had been traveling over snow for some time and it was hard to tell.  Although it was only afternoon, they decided to start looking wt a place to set up camp, and they cut across the land to the right baruc the upper feeder. They decided to stop ahead, just beyond the va of a fairly large stream that joined from the north side. j When Ayla saw an exposed gravel bar beside the river, she stopp1'"  ; out several smooth round stones that would be perfect for her and she put them in her pouch. She thought she might go hunt- r ptarmigan or white hare later in the afternoon, or perhaps the aorning.  oories of their short stay with the Losadunai were already fad- epia-ced by concerns about the glacier ahead, particularly for ar. On foot and heavily loaded, they had been traveling more r than he had planned and he feared the end of the long winter come too soon. The arrival of spring was always unpredictable, is was one year that he hoped it would be late.  y unloaded the horses and set up their camp. Since it was early, ecided to hunt fresh meat. They entered a lightly wooded area line across deer tracks, which surprised them both and worried ar. He hoped that returning deer were not a sign that spring soon follow. Ayla signaled Wolf, and they continued through oods single file, with Jondalar in front. Ayla followed close be- s.with Wolf at her heel. She did not want him dashing off and g away their prey.  |ey followed the trail through the open woods toward a high jut- Butcrop that blocked their view ahead. Ayla saw Jondalar's shoul- slump and the tension of his stalking relax, and she understood twhen the tracks of the deer showed that it had bounded away.  tthing had obviously scared it off.  ley both froze at the sound of Wolf's low growl. He sensed some- |and they had come to respect his warnings. Ayla was sure she jl scuffling noises from the other side of the large rock projecting rf the earth and blocking their path. She and Jondalar looked at jotfaer; the man had heard it too. They crept ahead slowly, edging (d the outcrop. Then there were shouts, the sound of something tng heavily, and, almost simultaneously, a scream of agony.  »ere was a quality to the scream that sent a chill down Ayla's back, 11 of recognition. "Jondalar! Someone's in trouble!" she said, dash- round the stone.  rait, Ayla! It could be dangerous!" he called in warning, but it dready too late. Clutching his spear, he raced to catch up.  Wind the outcrop, several young men were struggling with some- Mi the ground who was trying to fight them off without much ^s. Others were making crude remarks to a man who was on his s ^d stretched out on top of a person that two others were trying 'Id down.  lurry up, Danasi! How much more help do you need? This one's !gling."  "Maybe he needs help finding it." "He just doesn't know what to do with it." "Then give someone else a chance." Ay la caught a glimpse of blond hair and, with an angry feelino r^ disgust, she realized that they were holding down a woman and sk knew what they were trying to do. As she ran toward them, she had another insight. Perhaps it was the shape of a leg or an arm or rh sound of a voice, but suddenly she knew it was a Clan woman- blond Clan woman! She was stunned, but only for a moment.  Wolf was growling, eager, but watching Ayla and holding back.  "It must be Charoli's band!"Jondalar said, coming up behind her He dropped off his hunting pack with his spear holder, and in a few long strides he reached the three men who were molesting the woman He grabbed the one on top by the back of his parka at the scruff of his neck and yanked him off the woman. Then he stepped around and doubling up his fist, slammed it into the man's face. The man dropped to the ground. The other two gaped in shock, then let go of the woman and turned to attack the stranger. One jumped on his back, while the other threw punches at his face and chest. The big man flung off the one on his back, took a hard blow to his shoulder, and countered with a powerful belt to the stomach of the man in front of him.  The woman rolled over and backed off to get away when the two men went after Jondalar, and she ran toward the other group of struggling men. While one man was doubled over in pain, Jondalar turned to the other. Ayla saw the first one struggling to get up.  "Wolf! Help Jondalar! Get those men!" she said, signaling to the animal.  The big wolf raced eagerly into the fray, while she dropped her pack, loosened the sling from around her head, and reached into her pouch for stones. One man of the three was down again, and she watched another, with terror in his eyes, fling up an arm to fend off the huge wolf that was coming for him. The animal jumped up on his hind legs, sank his teeth into the arm of a heavy winter coat, and ripped off the sleeve, while Jondalar landed a solid punch on the jaw of the third.  Putting a stone in the pocket of her sling, Ayla turned her attention toward the other group of struggling men. One had raised a heavy bone club with two hands and was ready to smash it down. ^oe quickly hurled the stone and watched the man with the club fall to the . 4-/.'ri/'P ground. Another man, who was holding a spear in a threatening sia over someone on the ground, watched his friend fall with a loo incredulity. He shook his head and didn't see the second stone coming  ;lled in pain when it hit. The spear dropped to the ground as he id for his injured arm.  men had been struggling with the one on the ground, yet having 1 time of it. Her sling had brought two down, and the woman iad been attacked was pummeling a third, to good effect. The /as holding up his arms in defense. Another, who had gotten too to the man they had been trying to restrain, was jarred by a ful blow. He staggered back. Ayla had two more stones ready to ie let fly with one, aimed at a nonvital muscular thigh, giving the id man--a man of the Clan, as Ayla had guessed--an opening.  A he was sitting, he grabbed the man closest to him, lifted him ; ground, and threw him at another man.  ; Clan woman renewed her frenzied attack, finally driving away an she had been struggling with. Though not accustomed to ig, women of the Clan were as strong as their men, in proportion ir size. And though she would have preferred to acquiesce rather ight to defend herself against a man who wanted to use her to ; his needs, this woman had been moved to fight in defense of jured mate.  there was no fight left in any of the young men. One lay uncon- near the leg of the Clan man, a wound on his head oozing blood latted his dirty blond hair and was swelling into a discolored . Another was rubbing his arm, glowering at the woman who icr sling ready. The others were bruised and battered, one with ; that was puffing up and closing. The three who had been after Mnan were cowering in a huddle on the ground, their clothes in , in fear of a wolf who was standing watch over them with fangs and a mean snarl in his throat.  ialar, who had also taken a share of punishment but didn't seem ice, walked over to make sure Ayla was unharmed, then looked t at the man on the ground and was suddenly struck by the fact was a man of the Clan. He had known it when they first came the scene, but it hadn't made an impression until that moment.  mdered why the man was still down. He pulled the unconscious way from him, and rolled him over; he was breathing. And then r why the man of the Clan did not get up.  I reason was immediately apparent. The thigh of his right leg, »ove the knee, was bent at an unnatural angle. Jondalar looked at in with awe. With a broken leg, he had been holding off six men!  ew flatheads were strong, but he hadn't realized how strong, or letermined. The man had to be in great pain, but he was not igit.  ^ Suddenly another man, who had not been involved in any of Hi struggles, swaggered into view. He looked around at the battered band and raised an eyebrow. All the young men seemed to squirm wiri, discomfort under his disdain. They didn't know how to explain what had happened. One moment they were in the midst of roughing un and making sport with the two flatheads unfortunate enough to have crossed their path, and the next they were at the mercy of a woman who could sling rocks, hard, a big man with fists as hard as rocks, and the biggest wolf they had ever seen! Not to mention the two flatheads "What happened?" he asked.  "Your men have finally gotten a little back," Ayla said. "It will be your turn next." The woman was a total stranger. How did she know this was his band, or anything else about them? She spoke in his language, but with a strange accent, and he wondered who she was. The woman of the Clan turned her head at the sound of Ayla's voice and studied her closely, though it was not apparent to anyone else. The man with the bump on his head was waking up, and Ayla went to see how badly he was hurt.  "Get away from him," the man said, but the bravado was belied by the fear she detected in his voice.  Ayla paused, frankly appraised the man, and realized his objection was for the benefit of the band of men, not because he particularly cared about the one who was wounded.  She continued her examination. "He'll have a headache for a few days, but he'll be fine. If I had seriously meant to harm him, I would not have held back. He would be dead, Charoli." "How do you know my name?" the young man blurted out, frightened but trying not to show it. How did this stranger know who he was?  Ayla shrugged. "We know more than your name." She glanced in the direction of the man and woman of the Clan. To most of the people there, they seemed impassive, but Ayla could see their shock and uneasiness in the subtle shadings of expression and posture. They were warily watching the people of the Others, trying to make sense out of the strange turn of events.  For the time being, the man thought, they seemed to be in no danger of further attack, but that big man, why had he helped them • • • or seemed to help them. Why would a man of the Others fight men of his kind to help them? And what about the woman? If she was a woman.  She used a weapon, one he understood, better than most men he ^nev.' What kind of woman used a weapon? Against men of her own kind- more disquieting was the wolf, an animal that seemed to be Jig those men that had been hurting his woman... his own ial new woman. Perhaps the tall man had a Wolf Totem, but ere spirits, and that was a real wolf. All he could do was wait.  pain inside himself and wait.  his subtle glance at Wolf, and guessing his fears, Ayla de- 1 to get all the shocks over with at once. She whistled, a distinc- imperative sound that resembled the call of a bird, but no bird ie had ever heard. Everyone stared at her, apprehensively, but nothing happened immediately, they relaxed. Too soon. Before they heard hoofbeats, and then two docile horses, a mare and an iual brown stallion, appeared and went straight to the woman.  hat kind of strangeness was this? Was he dead, and in the world ie spirits? the man of the Clan wondered.  he horses seemed to frighten the young men even more than the >le of the Clan. Though they buried it under sarcasm and bravado, Iding each other into more and more daring and degrading activi- s, each of them carried a tight knot of guilt and fear deep inside.  meday, each man was sure, he would be discovered and held ac- untable. Some of them actually wished for it, to get it over with fore things got even worse, if it wasn't too late already.  Danasi, the one who had been subject to derision because he was ving trouble subduing the woman, had talked about it to a couple of f others that he thought he could trust. Flathead women were one Hag, but that girl, not even a woman yet, who cried and fought.  (anted, it was exciting at the time—women at that stage were always riting—but afterward he had been ashamed, and fearful of Duna's Eriburion. What would She do to them?  And now, suddenly here was a woman, a stranger, with a big fair- Bed man—wasn't Her lover supposed to be bigger and more fair i other men?—and a wolf! And horses that came at her call. No had ever seen her before, yet she knew who they were. She had a ge way of speaking, she must have come from far away, but she ' their language. Did they speak where she came from? Was she a ? A Mother spirit in human form? Danasi shuddered.  Tiat do you want with us?" Charoli said. "We weren't bothering We were just having a little fun with some flatheads. What's with having a little sport with some animals?" lar watched Ayla struggle to restrain herself. "And Madenia?" 1. "Was she animal, too?" knew! The young men looked at each other, and then to ill for guidance. The man's accent was not the same as hers. He was Zeiandonii. If the Zeiandonii knew, they wouldn't be able to f there and hide if they needed to, pretending to be on a Journey A way they'd planned. Who else knew? Was there any place they c'oul^ go?  "These people are not animals," Ayla said, with a cold rage thai made Jondalar look twice. He had never seen her quite so angry bin she was so controlled that he wasn't sure if the young men knew it "if they were animals, would you even try to force them? Do you force wolves? Do you force horses? No, you are looking for a woman and no woman wants you. These are the only women you can find " she said. "But these people are not animals." She glanced at the Clan couple. "You are the animals! You are hyenas! Snuffling around the middens and smelling rotten, smelling of your evil. Hurting people forcing women, stealing what is not yours. I will tell you, if you don't return now, you will lose everything. You will have no family, no Cave, no people, and you will never have a woman at your hearth.  You will spend your life as a hyena, always taking the leavings of others, and having to steal from your own people." "They know about that, too!" one of the men said.  "Don't say anything!" Charoli said. "They don't know, they're only guessing." "We know," Jondalar said. "Every people know." His command of their language was not perfect, but perfectly understandable.  "That's what you say, but we don't even know you," Charoli said.  "You're a stranger, not even Losadunai. We're not going back. We don't need anyone. We have our own Cave." "Is that why you need to steal food and force women?" Ayla said.  "A Cave without women at your hearths is no Cave." Charoli tried to assume a casual tone. "We don't need to listen to this. We'll take what we want, when we want--food, women. No one has stopped us before, and no one is going to now. Come on, let's get away from here," he said, turning to leave.  "Charoli!" Jondalar said, calling after the young man and catching up in a few strides.  "What do you want?" "I have something to give you," the big man said.  Then, without warning, Jondalar doubled up his fist and rammed it into Charoli's face. Charoli's head jerked back and he was lifted off his feet by the stunning blow.  "That's for Madenia!" Jondalar said, looking down at the man sprawled out on the ground. Then he turned on his heel and waike away.  \9. looked at the dazed young man. A trickle of blood flowed from »rner of his mouth, but she made no move to offer assistance.  of his friends helped him up. Then she turned her attention to land of young men, eying each one individually. They were a -looking lot, unkempt and dirty, their clothes tattered and grimy.  |r gaunt faces spoke of hunger, too. No wonder they had stolen V They were in need of the help and support from the family and Ids of a Cave. Perhaps the unrestricted life of roaming freely with toU's band had begun to lose its appeal and they were ready to m.  [hey are looking for you," she said. "Everyone has agreed that you i gone too far, even Tomasi, who is kin to Charoli. If you return to ' Caves and take what's coming to you, you may have a chance to your families again. If you wait until they find you, it will go (e for you." that why She was here? Had She come to warn them, Danasi dered, before it was too late? If they returned before they were d, and tried to make amends, would their Caves take them back?    fter Charoli's band left, Ayla approached the Clan couple. They watched with amazement both Ayla's direct confrontation of the and Jondalar's final punch that had knocked the other man down.  of the Clan never hit other men of the Clan, but all the men of Others were strange. They looked something like men, but they 't act much like men, especially the man that had been struck. All clans knew about him, and the man on the ground had to admit he felt a certain satisfaction in seeing that one downed. He was more pleased to see them all go.  ow he wished the other two would go. Their actions had been so tpected that they made him uncomfortable. He pst wanted to get to his clan, although he didn't know how he was going to do it a broken leg. Ayla's next gesture took both the man and woman pletely by surprise. Even Jondalar could see their stunned confu- She gracefully lowered herself to a cross-legged position in front ie man and looked demurely down at the ground.  ndalar was surprised himself. She had done that to him on occa- . usually when she had something important to say to him and was Tated because she couldn't find the words to express herself, but was the first time he had ever seen her use that posture in its ier context. It was a gesture of respect. She was requesting permis- to address him, but it astonished the tall man to see Ayla, who so capable and independent, approach this nathead, this man of  the Clan, with such deference. She had tried to explain to him on that it was courtesy, tradition, their manner of speaking, and not nec essarily denigrating, but Jondalar knew that no Zeiandonii woman any other woman he knew, would ever approach anyone, man woman, in that way.  As Ayla sat patiently waiting for the man to tap her shoulder she wasn't even sure if the sign language of these Clan people was the same as the language of the clan that had raised her. The distance between them was great, and these people had a different look. But she had noticed similarities of spoken languages, although the farther apart people lived, the less alike the language was. She could only hope that the sign language of these people would also be similar.  She thought their gestural language, like much of their knowledge and patterns of activities, came from their memories; the racial memories, akin to instinct, that each child was born with. If these people of the Clan came from the same ancient beginnings as the ones she had known, their language should be, at least, similar.  As she waited nervously, she began to wonder if the man had any idea what she was trying to do. Then she felt a tap on her shoulder and took a deep breath. It had been a long time since she had spoken with people of the Clan, not since she had been cursed.... She had to forget about that. She couldn't let these people know that she was dead as far as the Clan was concerned or they would cease to see her, just as though she didn't exist. She looked up at the man, and they studied each other.  He could see no hint of Clan in her. She was a woman of the Others.  She was not like one of those that seemed oddly deformed by a mixture of spirits, the way so many were born these days. But where had this woman of the Others learned the correct way to address a man?  Ayla had not seen a Clan face for many years, and his was a true Clan face, but it was not quite like the faces of the people she had known. His hair and beard were a lighter brown and appeared soft, and not quite as curly. His eyes were lighter, too, brown, but not the deep, liquid, almost black eyes of her people. His features were stronger, more accentuated: his brow ridges were heavier, his nose sharper, his face jutted out farther, his forehead even seemed to sweep back more abruptly, and his head was longer. He seemed somehow more Clan than her Clan.  Ayla started speaking with the gestures and words of the every ay language of Brun's clan, the language of the Clan she had learned as child. It was immediately apparent that he did not understand.  the man made some sounds. They had the tone and quality of voi A e Clan, rather guttural with the vowels almost swallowed, and she ained to understand.  The man had a broken leg and she wanted to help him, but she also mted to know more about these Clan people. In a certain way, she I more comfortable around them than the people of the Others. But |ielp him, she needed to communicate with him, to make him un- Istand. He spoke again and made signs. The gestures seemed as bugh they ought to be familiar, but she couldn't make sense of them, d his word sounds were not familiar to her at all. Was the language |ier Clan so different that she wouldn't be able to communicate with | clans in this region? A >.yla thought about how to make herself understood to the man of the Clan, glancing at the young woman sitting nearby who looked nervous and upset. Then, remembering the Clan Gathering she tried the ancient, formal, and primarily silent language that was used to address the world of the spirits, and to communicate with other clans that had a different common language.  The man nodded and made a gesture. Ay la felt a great wash of relief when she found that she understood him, and a rush of excitement.  These people did come from the same beginnings as her Clan! Sometime, in some far distant past, this man had the same ancestors as Creb and Iza. With a sudden insight, she recalled a strange vision, and knew that she, too, shared roots, even more ancient, with him, but her line had diverged, taken a different path.  Jondalar watched, fascinated, as they began to talk with signs. It was hard to follow the quick flowing movements they made, which gave him a sense of much greater complexity and subtlety to the language than he had supposed. When Ayla had taught people of the Lion Camp some of the Clan sign language so that Rydag could communicate with them for the first time in his life--the formal language because it was easier for the youngster to leam--she had taught them only the basic rudiments. The boy had always enjoyed talking with her more than anyone. Jondalar had guessed that Rydag could communicate with her more fully, but he was beginning to understand the range and depth of the language.  Ayla was surprised when the man skipped over some of the formalities of introduction. He didn't establish names, places, or kinship lines. "Woman of the Others, this man would know where you learned to speak." "When this woman was a young child, family and people were lost to an earthquake. This woman was raised by a clan," she explained.  "This man knows of no clan that took in a child of the Others, the man signed.  "The clan of this woman lives far away. Does the man know or t river known to the Others as Great Mother?"  It is the boundary," he motioned impatiently.  glie river goes on for a greater distance than many know, to a great tfar to the east. The clan of this woman lives beyond the end of |at Mother," Ayla signed.  Ie looked incredulous, then studied her. He knew that, unlike the Ie of the Clan whose language included the understanding of un- cious body movements and gestures, which made it almost impos- to say one thing and mean something else, the people of the rs, who spoke with sounds, were different. He couldn't be sure t her. He could see no signs of dissimulation, but her story seemed fetched.  his woman has been traveling since the beginning of last warm on," she added.  Ie became impatient again, and Ayla realized he was in great pain.  hat does the woman want? Others are gone, why does the woman t go?" He knew that she had probably saved his life and had helped I mate, which meant he owed her an obligation; that would make m the next thing to kin. The thought was unsettling.  'This woman is a medicine woman. This woman would look at the tl's leg," Ayla explained.  ie snorted with disdain. "The woman cannot be a medicine tnan. The woman is not Clan." JAyla did not argue. She thought a moment, then decided to try |)ther approach. "This woman would speak to the man of the Oth- fe," she requested. He nodded approval. She stood up, then backed Way before she turned around and went to talk tojondalar.  |"Are you able to communicate with him very well?" he asked her.  1'know you are making a good attempt, but the Clan you lived with sso far away, I can't help but wonder how successful you are." 1.'I started out using the everyday language of my clan, and we kuldn't understand each other. I should have known their ordinary gns and words would not be the same, but when I used ancient Tmal language, we had no trouble communicating," Ayla explained.  "Did I understand you right? Are you saying that the Clan can Bnmunicate in a way that is understood by all of them? No matter here they live? That's hard to believe." "I suppose it is," she said, "but their ancient way is in their memos." You mean they are born knowing how to speak in that way? Any ^y can do it?" 'Not exactly. They are born with their memories, but they have to ; taught' how to use them. I'm not sure how it works, I don't have ^ memories, but it seems to be more like 'reminding' them of what  [ I they know. Usually they only have to be reminded once, and then it' set. That's why some of them thought I wasn't very smart. I was sn slow to learn, until I taught myself to memorize fast, and even then it wasn't easy. Rydag had the memories, but he didn't have anyone to teach him... to remind him. That's why he didn't know the sien language until I came." "You, slow to learnI I've never seen anyone learn languages so fast " Jondalar said.  She shrugged off the comment. "That's different. I think the Others have a kind of memory for word language, but we learn to speak the sounds of those around us. To learn a different language, you just have to memorize another set of sounds, and sometimes another way of putting them together," she said. "Even if you aren't perfect, you can understand each other. His language is more difficult, for us, but communication isn't the problem I'm having with him. Obligation is the problem." "Obligation? I don't understand," Jondalar said.  "He's in terrible pain, though he'll never let you know it. I want to help him, I want to set that leg. I don't know how they're going to get back to their clan, but we can worry about that later. First I need to fix his leg. But he is already in our debt, and he knows that if I can understand his language, I understand the obligation. If he believes we saved his life, it's a kinship debt. He doesn't want to owe us more," Ay la said, trying to explain a very complex relationship in a simple way.  "What's a kinship debt?" "It's an obligation..." Ayla tried to think of a way to put it that would make it clear. "It's usually between hunters of a clan. If one man saves another man's life, he 'owns' a piece of the other's spirit.  The man that would have died gives up a piece to be restored to life.  Since a man doesn't want any pieces of his spirit to die--to walk the next world before he does--if another man owns a piece of his spirit, he will do anything to save that man's life. That makes them kin, closer than brothers." "That makes sense," Jondalar said, nodding.  "When men hunt together," Ayla continued, "they have to help each other, and they often save each other's lives, so a piece of each one s spirit usually belongs to each of the others. It makes them kin in a way that goes beyond family. Hunters in a clan may be related, but t kinship of family cannot be stronger than the bond between hunters, because they cannot favor one over the other. They all t1 to depend on each other." There is wisdom in that,"Jondalar said thoughtfully.  That's called a kinship debt. This man doesn't know the customs he Others, and he doesn't think much of what he does know." After Charoli and his band, who can blame him?" It goes much beyond that, Jondalar. But he's not happy about being hit debt." He told you all this?" No, of course not, but the language of the Clan is more than signs je with the hands. It's the way a person sits, or stands, expressions the face, small things, but they all have meaning. I grew up with a i. Those things are as much a part of me as they are of him. I know it's bothering him. If he could accept me as a medicine woman of Clan, it would help." What difference would that make?" Jondalar said.  It means I already own a piece of his spirit," Ayla said.  But you don't even know him! How can you own a piece of his rit?" A medicine woman saves lives. She could claim a piece of the spirit everyone she saves, could 'own' pieces of everyone before many rs have gone by. So when she is made a medicine woman, she gives iece of her spirit to the Clan, and receives a piece of every Clan son in return. That way, no matter who she saves, the debt is sady paid. That's why a medicine woman has status in her own it." Ayla looked thoughtful, then said, "This is the first time I'm i the Clan spirits were not taken back..." She paused.  ondalar started to speak. Then he noticed that she was staring into empty air, and he realized she was looking inside herself.  ... When I was cursed with death," she continued. "I've worried >ut that for a long time. After Iza died, Creb took all the spirit pieces k, so they would not go with her to the next world. But when »ud had me cursed, no one took them back from me, even though to Clan I am dead." What would happen if they knew that?" Jondalar asked, indicating h a discreet twist of his head the two Clan people who were watch- them.  I would not exist to them any more. They would not see me; they uld not let themselves see me. I could stand right in front of them I scream, and they would not hear it. They would think I was a bad ^t trying to trap them into the next world," Ayla said, closing her s and shuddering with the memory.  But why did you say you were glad that you still had the spirit ces?" Jondalar asked. "Because I can't say one thing and mean something else. I can't lie to him. He would know it. But I can refrain from mentioning. That's allowed, out of courtesy, for the sake of privacy. I don't have to saw anything about the curse, even though he would probably know I was holding something back, but I can talk about being a medicine woman of the Clan, because it's true. I still am. I still own the spirit pieces " She frowned then, with worry. "But someday I will really die, Jonda- lar. If I go to the next world with the spirit pieces of everyone in the Clan, what will happen to them?" "I don't know, Ayla," he said.  She shrugged, putting the thought aside. "Well, it's this world I need to worry about now. If he will accept me as a medicine woman of the Clan, then he won't have to be so concerned about owing a debt to me. It's bad enough for him to owe a kinship debt to one of the Others, but worse if it's a woman, especially one who used a weapon." "But you hunted when you lived with the Clan,"Jondalar reminded her.  "That was a special exception, and only because I survived a moon- cycle curse of death for hunting and using a sling. Brun allowed it because my Cave Lion totem protected me. He thought of it as a testing, and I think it finally gave him a reason to accept a woman with such a strong totem. He's the one who gave me my hunting talisman and called me the Woman Who Hunts." Ayla touched the leather bag she always wore around her neck, and thought of her first one, the simple drawstring pouch that Iza had made for her. As her mother, Iza had put the piece of red ochre inside it when Ayla was accepted by the Clan. That amulet was nothing like the finely decorated one she wore now, which had been given to her at her Mamutoi adoption ceremony, but it still held her special tokens, including that original piece of red ochre. All the signs her totem had given to her were in it, as well as the red-stained oval from the tip of a mammoth tusk that was her hunting talisman, and the black stone, the small chunk of black manganese dioxide that held the spirit pieces of the Clan, which had been given to her when she became the medicine woman ofBrun's clan.  "Jondalar, I think it would help if you would talk to him. He s unsure. His ways are very traditional, and too many unusual things have been going on. If he had a man to talk to, even one of the Others, rather than a woman, it might ease his mind. Do you remember the sign for a man to greet a man?" Jondalar made a motion, and Ayla nodded. She knew it lacked finesse, but the meaning was clear. "Don't attempt to greet the woman M et It would be in bad taste, and he might consider it an insult. It is at customary or appropriate for men to talk to women without a good Jason, especially strangers, and you will need his permission even ten. With kin, there are fewer formalities, and a close friend could len relieve his needs—share Pleasures—with her, though it's con- idered polite to ask his permission first." '<i"Ask his permission, but not hers? Why do the women allow them- dves to be treated as though they are less important than men?" »ndalar asked.  "They don't think of it that way. They know, within themselves, iat women and men are just as important, but men and women of the ,lan are very different from each other," Ayla tried to explain.  ;: "Of course they are different. All men and women are different.  mglad to say." "I don't just mean different in the way you can see. You can do dything a woman can do, Jondalar, except have a baby, and although ou are stronger, I can do almost everything you can do. But men of ? Clan cannot do many things that women do, just as women cannot o the things that men do. They don't have the memories for it. When taught myself to hunt, many people were more surprised that I had ms ability to learn, or even the desire, than that I had gone against the ray of the Clan. It wouldn't have astounded them any more if you had iven birth to a baby. I think the women were more surprised than the ien. The idea would never occur to a Clan woman." "I thought you said the people of the Clan and the Others are very mch alike," Jondalar said.  "They are. But in some ways, they are more different than you can nagine. Even I can't imagine it, and I was one of them, for a while," Lyia said. "Are you ready to talk to him now?" "I think so," he said.  The tall, blond man walked toward the powerful, stocky man who 'as still sitting on the ground, with his thigh bent at an unnatural agle. Ayla followed. Jondalar lowered himself to sit in front of the lan, glancing at Ayla, who nodded approval.  He had never been so close to an adult flathead male before, and his rst thought was a memory of Rydag. Looking at this man, it was even tore obvious that the boy had not been full Clan. As Jondalar recalled »e strange, bright, sickly child, he realized that Rydag's features had een greatly modified in comparison—softened was the word that came > him. This man's face was large, both long and wide, and jutted out Mnewhat, led by a sizable, protruding, sharp nose. His fine-haired card, which showed signs of having been recently trimmed to a uni- form length, did not entirely succeed in hiding a rather receding jaw with no chin.  His facial hair blended into a mass of thick, softly curled, liphr brown hair covering a huge, long head, that was full and rounded at the back. But the man's heavy brow ridges took up most of his forehead, which sloped back into a hairline that started low. Jondalar had to restrain an urge to reach up and touch his own sharply rising high forehead and domed head. He could understand why they were called flatheads. It was as if someone had taken a head that was shaped like his, but somewhat larger, and made of material as malleable as wet clay, then reshaped it by pushing down and flattening his forehead forcing the bulk of the size toward the back.  The man's heavy brows were accentuated by bushy eyebrows, and his gold-flecked, almost hazel eyes showed curiosity, intelligence, and an undercurrent of pain. Jondalar could understand why Ayla wanted to help him.  Jondalar felt clumsy making the gesture for greeting; but he was heartened by the look of surprise on the face of the man of the Clan, who returned the gesture. Jondalar wasn't sure what to do next. He thought about what he would do if he were meeting any stranger from another Cave or Camp, and he tried to remember the signs he had learned to make with Rydag.  He gestured, "This man is called..." then spoke his name and primary affiliation, "Jondalar of the Zeiandonii." It was too melodic, too full of syllables, too much for the man of the Clan to hear all at once. He shook his head, as if trying to unplug his ear, inclined his head, as though it would help him to listen better, then tapped Jondalar's chest.  It wasn't hard to understand what he meant, Jondalar thought. He made the signs again for "This man is called..." then spoke his name, but only his given name, and more slowly, "Jondalar." The man closed his eyes, concentrating, then opened them and, taking a breath, spoke out loud, "Dyondar." Jondalar smiled, and nodded yes. There was a deep-voiced, not fully articulated quality to the word, and a sense of swallowing the vowels, but it was close enough. And strangely familiar. Then it came to him.  Of course! Ayla! Her words still had that same quality, though not nearly as strong. That was her unusual accent. No wonder no one could identify it. She had a Clan accent, and no one knew they could talk!  Ayla was surprised at how well the man had said Jondalar's name- She doubted if she had said it that well the first time she tried, and she  ondered if this man had had contact with Others before. If he had gen chosen to represent his people, or make some form of contact ith the ones known as the Others, it would be an indication of high ttus. All the more reason, she understood, for him to be wary of aship bonds with Others, especially Others of unknown status. He Ddid not want to devalue his own status, but an obligation was an Duration, and whether he or his mate was ready to admit it, they still seded help. Somehow she had to convince him that they were Others go understood the significance and were worthy of the association.  ;The man facing Jondalar slapped his chest once, then leaned forward ghdy. "Guban," he said.  Jondalar had as much trouble repeating his name as Guban had had ith "Jondalar," and Guban was as generous in accepting the tall man's ispronunciation as Jondalar had been of his.  Ayla felt relieved. An exchange of names wasn't much, but it was a art. She glanced at the woman, still startled to see hair coloring thter than her own on a woman of the Clan. Her head was covered ith a fluff of soft curls, so light that it was almost white, but she was Oung and very attractive. Probably a second woman at his hearth.  Suban was a man in his prime, and this woman was probably from a afferent clan, and quite a prize.  I; The woman looked at Ayla, then away quickly. Ayla wondered.  the had seen worry and fear in the woman's eyes and looked more closely, but with as much subtlety as the young Clan woman had used.  Was there a thickening at the waist? Did her wrap fit a little tight tcross her breasts? She's pregnant! No wonder she's worried. A man with a. badly healed broken leg would no longer be in his prime. And icfaile this man might have high status, he no doubt had heavy respon- ibiliries as well. Somehow, Ayla thought, she had to convince Guban D let her help him.  The two men had been sitting watching each other. Jondalar was fot sure what to do next, and Guban was waiting to see what he would k». Finally, in desperation, he turned to her.  "This woman is Ayla," he said, using his simple signs and then peaking her name.  At first Ayla thought he might have committed a social blunder, but ceing Guban's reaction, decided perhaps not. Introducing her so (Ulcldy was an indication of the high esteem in which she was held, ippropriate for a medicine woman. Then, as he continued, she won- tered if he had seen into her thoughts.  Ayla is healer. Very good healer. Good medicine. Want help Suban." To the man of the Clan, Jondalar's signs were hardly more than baby talk. There were no nuances to his meaning, no suggestive shad ings, no degrees of complexity, but his sincerity was clear. It was a surprise in itself to discover a man of the Others who could speak properly at all. Most of them chattered, or muttered, or growled like animals. They were like children in their excessive use of sound but then, the Others weren't considered very bright.  The woman, on the other hand, had a surprising depth of understanding with a fine grasp of nuance; and a clear and expressive ability to communicate. With inconspicuous finesse, she had translated some of Dyondar's subtler meanings, easing their communication without embarrassment to anyone. As difficult as it was to believe that she had been raised by a clan and had traveled such a great distance, she was so adept at speaking that one could almost believe she was Clan.  Guban had never heard of the clan of whom the woman spoke, and he knew many, but the common language she had used was quite unfamiliar. Even the language of the clan of his yellow-hair was not as strange, yet this woman of the Others knew the ancient sacred signs and could use them with great skill and precision. Rare for a woman.  There was a suggestion that she might be withholding something, though he couldn't be certain. She was, after all, a woman of the Others, and he wouldn't ask in any case. Women, especially medicine women, liked to keep a few things to themselves.  The pain of his broken leg throbbed and threatened to escape his control, and he had to focus on holding it in for a time.  But how could she be a medicine woman? She wasn't Clan. She had no memories for it. Dyondar claimed she was a healer, and he spoke of her skill with great conviction... and his leg was broken--Guban flinched inwardly, then gritted his teeth. Perhaps she was a healer; the Others had to have them, too, but that didn't make her a medicine woman of the Clan. His obligation was already so great. A kinship debt to this man would be bad enough, but to a woman, and a woman who used a weapon?  Yet where would he and his yellow-hair be without their help? His yellow-hair... and expecting a young one already. The thought of her made him feel soft inside. He had felt anger beyond anything he had ever known when those men went after her, hurting her, trying to take her. That was why he had jumped down from the top of the rock.  It had taken him a long time to climb to the top, and he couldn't wait that long to get back down.  He had seen deer tracks and had climbed up to look around, to see what he might hunt, while she collected inner bark and set taps fortne  e that would soon be rising. She had said it would warm soon, Hugh some of the others hadn't believed her. She was still a stranger, ^^jhe said she had the memories for it and knew. He wanted to let prove it to the others, so he had agreed to take her out, though he w the dangers... from those men.  tut it was cold, and he thought they'd avoid them if they stayed g to the icetop. The top of the rock seemed like a good place to Kut the area. The agonizing pain when he landed hard and felt his f snap made him dizzy, but he could not succumb. The men were top of him, and he had to fight them, pain or no. He felt warmed Kiembering how she had rushed to him. He had been surprised to e her hitting at those men. He had never known a woman to do that, Bd he would never tell anyone, but it had pleased him that she had Red so hard to help him.  B'He shifted his weight, controlling the sharp stab of pain. But it jbsn't so much the pain. He had learned long ago to resist pain. Other its were harder to control. What would happen if he could never llk again? A broken leg or arm could take a long time to heal, and if ; bones mended wrong, twisted, or misshapen, or too short.  |hat if he couldn't hunt?  If he couldn't hunt, he would lose status. He would no longer be ader. He had promised the leader of her clan to take care of her. She id been a favorite, but his status was great, and she wanted to go Jnth him. She even told him, in the privacy of their own furs, that she lad wished for him.  I His first woman had not been too happy when he came home with (young and beautiful second woman, but she was a good Clan woman.  |he had taken good care of his hearth, and she would keep the status if First Woman. He promised to take care of her and her two daugh- lers. He hadn't minded that. Though he had always wished she would tove a son, the daughters of his mate were a delight to have around the tearth, though they would soon be grown and gone.  f, But if he couldn't hunt, he wouldn't be able to take care of anyone.  wsk an old man, the clan would have to take care of him instead. And bs beautiful yellow-hair, who might give birth to a son, how could he >ke care of her? She would have no trouble finding a man willing to ake her, but he would lose her.  He could not even get back to the clan if he couldn't walk. She Could have to go for help, and they would have to come and get him.  » he couldn't make it back on his own, he would be less in the eyes of tts clan, but it would be so much worse if the broken leg slowed him town and he lost his skill at hunting, or could never hunt again.  Perhaps I should talk to this healer of the Others, he thought, even if she is a woman who uses a weapon. Her status must be high, Dvon- dar holds her in high regard, and his must be high, or he would not be mated to a medicine woman. She had made those other men leave as much as the man... she and the wolf. Why would a wolf help them?  He had seen her talking to the animal. The signal was simple and direct, she told him to wait over there, by the tree near the horses, but the wolf understood her and did it. He was still there, waiting.  Guban looked away. It was difficult even to think about those animals without feeling a deep, underlying fear of spirits. What else would draw the wolf or the horses to them? What else would make animals behave so... unlike animals?  He could tell his yellow-hair was worried; how could he blame her?  Since Dyondar had seen fit to acknowledge his woman, perhaps it would be appropriate to mention his. He would not want them to think the status she gained from him was any less than Dyondar's.  Guban made a very subtle motion to the woman who had watched and seen everything, but, like a good Clan woman, had managed to make herself very inconspicuous.  "This woman is..." he motioned, then tapped her shoulder and said, "Yorga." Jondalar had the impression of two swallows separated by a rolled R. He could not even begin to reproduce the sound. Ayla saw his struggle, and she had to think of a way to gracefully handle the situation.  She repeated her name in a way Jondalar could say it, but addressed her as a woman.  "Yorga," adding with signs, "this woman greets you. This woman is called..." and very slowly and carefully said, "Ayla." Then in both signs and words, so Jondalar could understand, "The man named Dyondar would also greet the woman of Guban." It was not the way it would have been done in the Clan, Guban thought, but then these people were Others, and it was not offensive.  He was curious to see what Yorga would do.  She nicked her eyes injondalar's direction, very briefly, then looked back down at the ground. Guban shifted position just enough to let her know he was pleased. She had acknowledged Dyondar's existence, but no more.  Jondalar was less subtle. He had never been so close to Clan people ... and he was fascinated. His look took much longer. Her features were similar to Guban's, with feminine modifications, and he ha noticed before that she was sturdy but short, the height of a girl. She was far from beautiful, at least in his opinion, except for her pa ^1Q How, downy-soft fluff of curls, but he could understand why Guban At think so. Suddenly mindful of Guban watching him, he nodded rfunctorily, then looked away. The Clan man was glowering; he mid have to be careful.  Ruban hadn't liked the attention Jondalar had paid to his woman, K he did sense there was no lack of respect intended, and he was ring more difficulty controlling his pain. He needed to know more gut this healer.  "I would speak to your... healer, Dyondar," Guban signed.  fcndalar got the sense of his meaning and nodded. Ay la had been tching, quickly came forward, and sat in respectful posture in front Itfae man.  "Dyondar has said the woman is a healer. The woman says medicine Oman. Guban would know how a woman of the Others can be a cdicine woman of the Clan." Ayla spoke as she made the signs, so that Jondalar would understand Bcdy what she was telling Guban. "The woman who took me in, 10 raised me, was a medicine woman of highest rank. Iza came from ost ancient line of medicine woman. Iza was like mother to this Oman, trained this woman with the daughter born to the line," Ayla Epiained. She could see he was skeptical but interested in knowing |ore. "Iza knew this woman did not have the memories as her true laughter did." t Guban nodded, of course not.  | "Iza made this woman remember, made this woman tell Iza over and liver, show over and over, until the medicine woman knew this woman KOuld not lose the memories. This woman was happy to practice, to Bpeat many times to learn the ways of a medicine woman." f Although her gestures remained stylized and formal, her words be- attne less so as she continued her explanation.  "Iza told me she thought this woman came from a long line of med- dne women, too, medicine women of the Others. Iza said I thought lie a medicine woman, but she taught me how to think about medicine Bte a woman of the Clan. This woman was not born with the memo- esofa medicine woman, but Iza's memories are my memories now." Ayla had everyone's attention. "Iza got sick, a coughing sickness that ot even she could heal, and I began to do more. Even the leader was tteased when I treated a burn, but Iza gave status to the clan. When he was too sick to make the trip to the Clan Gathering, and her true laughter was still too young, the leader and the Mog-ur decided to Qake me medicine woman. They said that since I had her memories, I ^as a medicine woman of her line. The other mog-urs and leaders at />70 the Clan Gathering didn't like the idea at first, but they finally accepted me, too." Ayla could see Guban was interested, and she sensed he wanted tn believe her, but he still had doubts. She took off the decorated bao from around her neck, untied the cords, and spilled out some of the contents into her palm, then picked out a small black stone and held it out to him.  Guban knew what it was, the black stone that would leave a mark was a mystery. Even the smallest piece could hold a tiny fraction of the spirits of all the people of the Clan, and was given to a medicine woman when a piece of hers was taken. The amulet she wore was strange, he thought, typical of the way the Others made things, but he hadn't known they wore amulets at all. Maybe the Others weren't all ignorant and brutish.  Guban noticed another of the objects from her amulet and pointed to it. "What is that?" Ayla put the rest of her objects back in her amulet and put it down so she could answer. "It is my hunting talisman," she said.  That could not be true, Guban thought. This would prove her wrong. "Women of the Clan do not hunt." "I know, but I was not born to the Clan. I was chosen by a Clan totem who protected me and led me to the clan that became mine, and my totem wanted me to hunt. Our mog-ur reached back and found the old spirits who told him. They made a special ceremony. I was called the Woman Who Hunts." "What is this Clan totem that chose you?" Much to Guban's surprise, Ayla lifted her tunic, unloosened the drawstring ties from around the waist of her leggings, and lowered the side enough to show her left thigh. Four parallel lines, the scars left by the claws that had raked her thigh when she was a girl, showed clearly.  "My totem is the Cave Lion." The Clan woman caught her breath. The totem was too strong for a woman. It would be difficult for her to have children.  Guban grunted acknowledgment. The Cave Lion was the strongest hunting totem, a man's totem. He had never known a woman to have it, yet those were the marks that were cut into the right thigh of a boy whose totem was the Cave Lion, after he'd made his first major kill and become a man. "It is on the left leg. The mark is put on a man's right leg." "I am a woman, not a man. The woman's side is the left side." "Your mog-ur marked you there?" "The Cave Lion himself marked me, when I was a girl, just before my clan found me."  'That would explain using the weapon," Guban signed, "but what |»ut children? Does this man with hair the color of Yorga's have a jyn strong enough to overcome such a totem?" gbndalar looked uncomfortable. He had wondered something like |t himself.  ^The Cave Lion also chose him, and left his mark. I know because lie Mog-ur told me the Cave Lion chose me, and put the marks on ''y leg to show it, just as the Cave Bear chose him, and took his ' »» re.  iGuban sat up, visibly shaken. He slipped out of the formal language, It Ay la understood him.  "Mogor One-Eye! You know Mogor One-Eye?" "I lived at his hearth. He raised me. He and Iza were siblings, and ter her mate died, he took her and her children in. At the Clan athering, he was called the Mog-ur, but to those who lived at his arth, he was Creb." "Even at our Clan Gatherings, there is talk of Mogor One-Eye, and s powerful..." He was going to say more, but thought better of it.  .en were not supposed to talk about the private esoteric male cere- onies around women. That would explain her skill with the ancient ps', too, if she was taught by Mogor One-Eye. And Guban did recall at the great Mogor One-Eye had a sibling who was a respected edicine woman from an ancient line. Suddenly Guban seemed to lax, and he allowed a fleeting look of pain to cloud his face. He took deep breath, then looked at Ayla, who was sitting cross-legged, look- g down, in the position of a proper Clan woman. He tapped her oulder.  "Respected medicine woman, this man has a... small problem," uban signaled in the ancient silent language of the Clan of the Cave ;ar. "This man would ask the medicine woman to look at leg. The ], may be broken." Ayla closed her eyes and let out her breath. She had managed to nvince him. He would allow her to treat his leg. She signaled to irga, telling her to prepare a sleeping place for him. The broken bone d not pierced the skin, and she thought there was a good chance that ' would have full use of it again, but for the leg to heal properly, she auld have to straighten it, set it back in place, and then she would ike a birchbark cast to hold it stiff, so he could not move it.  "It will be painful to straighten it, but I have something that will lax the leg, and make him sleep." Then she turned to Jondalar. "Will 'u move our camp here? I know it's a chore with all those burning Mies, but I want to set up the tent for him. They didn't plan to be ne overnight, and he needs to be out of the cold, especially when I  give him something to sleep. We'll need some firewood, too, I don't want to use the burning stones, and we'll need to cut some wood for splints. I'll get birchbark when he's asleep, and maybe I can make some crutches for him. He'll want to move around later." Jondalar watched her take charge, and he smiled to himself. Hp hated the delay, even one more day seemed too much, but he wanted to help, too. Besides, Ayla wouldn't leave now. He just hoped they wouldn't be there too long.    Jondalar took the horses to their first camp, repacked, moved, and unpacked again, then led Whinney and Racer to a clearing where they could search out dried grass. There was some standing hay, but more flat against the ground under old snow. It was a little distance from their new location, but out of sight so the animals would trouble the Clan people less. They seemed to think that the tame animals were another manifestation of the strange behavior of Others, but Ayla noticed that both Guban and Yorga seemed relieved when the unnaturally complaisant horses were out of sight, and she was pleased that Jondalar had thought of it.  As soon as he returned, Ayla got her medicine bag out of a pack basket. For all that he had decided to accept her help as a medicine woman, Guban was relieved to see her old Clan-style otter-skin medicine bag, functional and not decorated. She made a point of keeping Wolf out of the way as well, and strangely, the animal, though usually curious and approachable by people whom Ayla and Jondalar had made friends with, showed no inclination to befriend the people of the Clan. He seemed content to stay in the background, watchful, though in no way menacing, and Ayla wondered if he sensed their uneasiness about him.  Jondalar helped Yorga and Ayla move Guban into the tent. He was surprised at how much the man weighed, but the sheer volume of muscle in a body so strong that six men could barely hold it down, was bound to add weight. Jondalar also realized that the move was very painful, though Guban's impassive face showed no sign of it. The man's refusal to admit pain made Jondalar wonder if he felt it as much, until Ayla explained that such stoic denial was ingrained in Clan men from boyhood. Jondalar's respect for the man increased. His was not a race of weaklings.  The woman was amazingly strong, too, smaller than the man but not greatly so. She could lift as much as Jondalar could, and when she chose to exert force, the grip of her hand was unbelievably powerful, yet he'd seen her use her hands with fine precision and control. W  . becoming intrigued with discovering the similarities between peo- fcbfthe Clan and his own kind, as well as the differences. He wasn't exactly when it happened, but at some point he realized that he anger questioned in any way the fact that they were human. They e different, certainly, but most definitely the people of the Clan e people, not animals.  ^yla ended up using a few of the burning stones after all to make a |ter fire to prepare the datura more quickly, adding hot cooking lies directly to the water to make it boil. But Guban resisted drink- [ all that she felt he should, claiming that he didn't like the idea of iring too long for its effects to wear off, but she wondered if part of [problem was his doubt whether she could prepare the datura prop- y. With help from both Yorga and Jondalar, Ayla set the leg, and in made a sturdy splint. When it was all over, Guban finally slept.  |¥orga insisted on making the meal, although Jondalar's interest in processes and tastes embarrassed her. At night, by the fire, he a whittling out a pair of crutches for Guban, while Ayla enjoyed ig acquainted with Yorga and explained to her how to make med- for pain. Ayla described the use of crutches and the need for (adding under the arms. Yorga was constantly surprised at Ay la's Sftowledge of the Clan and Clan ways, but she had noticed her Clan fcccent" earlier. Eventually she told Ayla about herself, and Ayla panslated for Jondalar.  I'Yorga wanted to get inner bark and tap certain trees. Guban had ome along to protect her because so many women had been attacked |y Charoli's band that no women were allowed to go out alone any Bore, which was a hardship on the clan. Men had less time to hunt ince they had to spend time accompanying women. That was why Suban decided to climb the big rock, to look for animals to hunt while Forga collected inner bark. Charoli's men probably thought she was lone, and they might not have attacked if they had seen Guban, but chen he saw them attack her, he jumped off the wall to her defense.  "I'm surprised all he broke was one leg," Jondalar said, looking up t the top of the wall.  "Clan bones are very heavy," Ayla said, "and thick. They don't •reak very easily." "Those men didn't have to be so rough with me," Yorga commented, Wh signs. "I would have assumed the position if they had given me "e signal, and if I hadn't heard his scream. I knew something was very "•ongthen." She continued with the story. Several men attacked Guban, while tiree tried to force Yorga. From his scream of pain, she knew some- thing was wrong with Guban, so she tried to get away from the mp That's when the other two held her down. Then suddenly Jondal was there, hitting the men of the Others, and the wolf jumped at them and was biting them.  She looked at Ay la slyly. "Your man is very tall, and his nose is very small, but when I saw him there fighting the other men, this woman could think of him as a child." Ay la looked puzzled, and then she smiled.  "I didn't quite understand what she said, or what she meant," Jon- dalar said.  "She made a little joke." "A joke?" he said. He didn't think they were capable of making jokes.  "What she said, more or less, is that even though you are an ugly man, when you came to her rescue, she could have kissed you," Ayla said, then explained to Yorga.  The woman looked embarrassed, but glanced toward Jondalar, then looked again at Ayla. "I am grateful to your tall man. Perhaps, if the child I carry is a boy, and if Guban will allow me to suggest a name, I will say to him, Dyondar is not such a bad name." "That wasn't a joke, was it, Ayla?" Jondalar said, surprised at the sudden rush of feeling.  "No, I don't think that was a joke, but she can only suggest, and it could be a difficult name for a boy of the Clan to grow up with because it's unusual. Guban might be willing, though. He's exceptionally open to new ideas, for a man of the Clan. Yorga told me about their mating, and I think they fell in love, which is quite rare. Most matings are planned and arranged." "What makes you think they fell in love?" Jondalar asked. He was interested in hearing a Clan love story.  "Yorga is Guban's second woman. Her clan lives quite far from here, but he went there to bring word of a large Clan Gathering, and plans to discuss us, the Others. Charoli bothering their women, for one thing --I told her about the Losadunai plans to put a stop to them--but if I understand it right, some group of Others have approached a couple of clans about some trading." "That's a surprise!" "Yes. Communication is the biggest problem, but men of the Clan, including Guban, don't trust the Others. While Guban was visiting the distant clan, he saw Yorga, and she saw him. Guban wanted her, but the reason he gave was to establish closer ties with some of the distant clans, so they could share news, particularly about all these ^ ideas. He brought her back with him! Men of the Clan don't do at. Most of them would have made an intention known to the leader, turned and discussed it with his own clan, and given his first woman chance to get used to the idea of sharing her hearth with another Wnan," Ayla said.  "The first woman at his hearth didn't know? That's a brave man," ndalar said.  "His first woman had two daughters; he wants a woman who will die a son. Men of the Clan put great store in the sons of their mates, d, of course, Yorga hopes the baby she is carrying will be the boy ; wants. She has had some trouble getting used to the new clan-- ey've been slow to accept her--and if Guban's leg doesn't heal prop- ly, and he loses status, she's afraid they will blame her." "No wonder she seemed so upset." Ayla refrained from mentioning to Jondalar that she had told Yorga e was on her way to her man's home, away from her people, too.  ie didn't see any reason to add to his worries, but she was still ncemed about how his people would accept her.  Ayla and Yorga both wished it was possible to visit with each other d share their experiences. They felt they were almost kin, since there is probably a kinship debt between Guban and Jondalar, and Yorga It closer to Ayla, in the brief time they had known each other, than any of the other women she had met. But Clan and Others didn't sit.  Guban woke up in the middle of the night, but he was still groggy.  t morning he was alert, but reaction to the stresses of the previous y left him exhausted. When Jondalar ducked his head in the tent in e afternoon, Guban was surprised at how glad he was to see the tall in, but he didn't know what to make of the crutches he held.  "I use same thing after lion attack me," Jondalar explained. "Help s walk." Guban was suddenly interested and wanted to try them, but Ayla wild not allow it. It was too soon. Guban finally acquiesced, but only :er announcing that he would try them the next day. In the evening, )rga let Ayla know that Guban wanted to talk to Jondalar about some ry important matters and was requesting her help with translation.  ie knew it was serious, guessed what it was about, and talked to ndalar in advance so she could help him to understand what the B&culties might be.  Guban was still concerned about owing a kinship debt to Ayla, yond the acceptable medicine woman spirit exchange, since she Iped save his life using a weapon.    c>8S "We need to convince him that the debt is owed to you, Jondalar. If you tell him that you are my mate, you could tell him that since yon have responsibility for me, any debts owed to me are actually owed tn you." Jondalar agreed, and after some preliminaries to establish procedures, they began the more serious discussion. "Ayla is my mate she belongs to me," he said, while Ayla translated with the full range of subtleties. "I am responsible for her, debts owed to her are owed to me." Then, to her surprise, Jondalar added, "I, too, have an obligation that weighs on my spirit. I owe a kinship debt to the Clan." Guban was curious.  "The debt has weighed heavily on my spirit because I haven't known how to repay it." "Tell me about it," Guban signed. "Perhaps I can help." "I was attacked by a cave lion, as Ayla mentioned. Marked, chosen by the Cave Lion, which is now my totem. It was Ayla who found me. I was near death, and my brother, who was with me, already walked the spirit world." "I am sorry to hear that. It is hard to lose a brother." Jondalar only nodded. "If Ayla had not found me, I, too, would be dead, but when Ayla was a child, and near death, the Clan took her in and raised her. If the Clan had not taken Ayla in when she was a child, she would not have lived. If Ayla had not lived and been taught to heal by a Clan medicine woman, I would not be alive. I would be walking in the next world now. I owe my life to the Clan, but I don't know how to pay that debt, or to whom." Guban nodded with great sympathy. It was a serious problem and a large debt.  "I would make a request of Guban," Jondalar continued. "Since Guban owes a kinship debt to me, I ask him to accept my kinship debt to the Clan in exchange." The man of the Clan considered the request gravely, but he was grateful to learn of the problem. Exchanging a kinship debt was far more acceptable than simply owing his life to a man of the Others, and giving him a piece of his spirit. Finally he nodded. "Guban will accept the exchange," he said, feeling great relief.  Guban took his amulet from around his neck and opened it. He shook the contents into his hand and picked out one of the objects, a tooth, one of his own first molars. Though he had no cavities, his teeth were worn down in a peculiar way, mainly because he used them as a tool. The tooth in his hand was worn, but not nearly so badly as his permanent teeth.  "Please accept this as a token of kinship," Guban said.  londalar was embarrassed. He hadn't realized there would be an Aange of some personal token to mark the exchange of debts, and Ididn't know what to give to the man of the Clan that would be as aningful. They were traveling very light, and he had very little to e. Suddenly it came to him.  He took a pouch from a loop of his belt and poured its contents into hand. Guban looked surprised. In Jondalar's hand were several was and two canine teeth of a cave bear, the cave bear he had killed ; previous summer shortly after they had started on their long Your- f. He held out one of the teeth. "Please accept this as a token of r^P-" | Guban restrained his eagerness. A cave bear tooth was a powerful ken, it bestowed high status, and the giving of one showed great inor. It pleased him to think that this man of the Others had acknowl- Iged his position, and the debt he owed the entire Clan so appropri- dy. It would make the proper impression when he told the rest about is exchange. He accepted the token of kinship, closed it inside his t, and gripped it firmly.  "Good!" Guban said with finality, as though completing a trade.  |hen he made a request. "Since we are now kin, perhaps we should now the location of each other's clan, and the territory they use." Jondalar described the general location of his homeland. Most of the rritory across the glacier was Zeiandonii or related, and then he scribed specifically the Ninth Cave of the Zeiandonii. Guban de- ribed his homeland, and Ayla got the impression they were not as r from each other as she had supposed.  Charoli's name came up before they were through. Jondalar talked ^bout the problems the young man had been creating for everyone, |8nd he explained in some detail what they planned to do to stop him.  Guban thought the information was important enough to tell other |dans, and he wondered to himself if his broken leg might not turn out ;to be a great asset.  I Guban would have much to tell to his clan. Not only that the Others ^themselves had problems with the man, and planned to do something about it, but that some of the Others were willing to fight their own land to help people of the Clan. There were also some who could speak properly! A woman who could communicate very well, and a man With limited but useful ability, which in some ways could be more valuable because he was a male, and he was now kin. Such contact With Others, and the insights and knowledge about them, could bring "un even more status, especially if he had full use of his leg again.  Ayla applied the birchbark cast in the evening. Guban went to bed feeling very good. And his leg hardly pained him at all.  Ayla woke up in the morning feeling very uneasy. She had a strange dream again, very vivid, with caves and Creb in it. She mentioned it to Jondalar; then they talked about how they were going to get Guban back to his people. Jondalar suggested the horses, but he was very worried about delaying any longer. Ayla felt that Guban would never consent. The tame horses upset him.  When they got up, they helped Guban out of the tent, and while Ayla and Yorga prepared a morning meal, Jondalar demonstrated the crutches. Guban insisted on trying, over Ayla's objections, and after a little practicing, was surprised at how effective they were. He could actually walk without putting any weight on his leg.  "Yorga," Guban called to his woman, after he put the crutches down, "make ready to leave. After the morning meal, we will go. It is time to return to the clan." "It's too soon," Ayla said, using the Clan gestures at the same time.  "You need to rest your leg, or it will not heal properly." "My leg will rest while I walk with these." He motioned toward the crutches.  "If you must go now, you can ride one of the horses," Jondalar said.  Guban looked startled. "No! Guban walks on own legs. With the help of these walking sticks. We will share one more meal with new kin, and then we go."    - t-fter sharing their morning meal, both couples prepared to » their separate ways. When Guban and Yorga were ready, they mply looked at Jondalar and Ayla for a moment, avoiding the wolf (d two horses packed with gear. Then, leaning on his crutches, uban began hobbling away. Yorga fell in behind him.  There were no goodbyes, no thank-yous; such concepts were foreign the people of the Clan. It wasn't customary to comment on one's sparture, it was obvious, and acts of assistance or kindness, especially from kin, were expected. Understood obligations required no thanks, dy reciprocity, should it ever be necessary. Ayla knew how difficult could be if Guban ever had to reciprocate. In his mind, he owed .em more than he might ever be able to repay. He had been given ore than his life; he had been given a chance to retain his position, s status, which meant more to him than simply being alive--espe- rily if that meant living as a cripple.  "I hope they don't have far to go. Traveling any distance on those alking sticks is not easy," Jondalar said. "I hope he makes it." "He'll make it," Ayla said, "no matter how far it is. Even without e walking sticks, he would get back, if he had to crawl the whole ay. Don't worry, Jondalar. Guban is a man of the Clan. He will ake it... or die in the trying." Jondalar's brow wrinkled into a thoughtful frown. He watched Ayla he Whinney's lead rope; then he shook his head and found Racer's.  ^ spite of the difficulty for Guban, he had to admit he was glad they id refused his offer of riding back to their clan on the horses. There id been too many delays already.    From their campsite, they continued riding through open woods ttil they reached a high point; then they stopped and looked out over e way they had come. Tall pines, standing straight as sentinels, larded the banks of the Mother River for a long distance back; a Hiding column of trees leading away from the legion of conifers they 'uld see below, spreading out over the flanks of the mountains that owded close from the south.  Ahead their uphill climb temporarily leveled off, and an extension of the pine forest, starting at the river, marched across a small valley.  They dismounted to lead the horses into the dense woodland and entered a twilight space of profound and eerie silence. Straight dark boles supported a low canopy of spreading long-needled boughs that blocked sunlight and inhibited undergrowth. A layer of brown needles, accumulating for centuries, muffled both footsteps and hoof- beats.  Ayla noticed a collection of mushrooms at the base of a tree, and she knelt to examine them. They were frozen solid, caught by a sudden frost of the previous autumn that had never let up. But no snow had filtered in to betray the season. It was as though the time of harvest had been captured and held in suspension, preserved in the still cold forest. Wolf appeared beside her and pushed his muzzle into her ungloved hand. She rubbed the top of his head, noticed his steamy breath and then her own, and had a fleeting impression that their small company of travelers were the only things alive.  On the far side of the valley, the climb became precipitous and shimmery silver fir appeared, accented by stately deep green spruce.  The long-needled pines became stunted with increasing elevation and finally disappeared, leaving the spruce and fir to march beside the Middle Mother.  As he rode, Jondalar's thoughts kept returning to the Clan people they had met--he would never again be able to think about them as anything other than people. I need to convince my brother. Perhaps he could try to make contact with them--if he is still leader. When they stopped to rest and make some hot tea, Jondalar spoke his thoughts out loud.  "When we get home, I'm going to talk to Joharran about the Clan people, Ayla. If other people can trade with them, we could, too, and he should know that they are meeting with distant clans to discuss the troubles they are having with us," Jondalar said. "It could mean trouble and I would not want to fight the likes of Guban." "I don't think there is any hurry. It will take a long time for them to reach any decisions. Change is difficult for them," Ayla said.  "What about trading--do you think they would be willing?" "I think Guban would be more willing than most. He's interested in knowing more about us, and he was willing to try the walking sticks, even if he wouldn't ride the horses. Bringing home such an unusual woman from a faraway clan shows something about him, too. He was taking a chance, even if she is beautiful." "Do you think she is beautiful?"  Don't you?" (I can see why Guban would think so," Jondalar said.  B guess what a man considers beautiful depends on who he is," she es, and I think you are beautiful." smiled, making him all the more convinced of her beauty. "I'm d you think so." 'It is true, you know. Remember all the attention you got at the Either Ceremony? Did I ever tell you how glad I was that you picked |?" he said, smiling at the memory.  |She recalled something he had said to Guban. "Well, I belong to Id don't I?" she said, then grinned. "It's good that you don't know |an language too well. Guban would have seen that you were not leaking true when you said I was your mate." "No, he wouldn't. We may not have had a Matrimonial yet, but in y heart, we are mated. It wasn't a lie," Jondalar said.  Ayla was moved. "I, too, feel that way," she said softly, looking >wn because she wanted to show deference to the emotions that filled |er. "I have since the valley." | Jondalar felt such a fierce surge of love fill him that he thought he |buld burst. He reached for her and took her in his arms, feeling at hat moment, with those few words, that he had experienced a Mating ceremonial. It didn't matter if he ever had one that would be recog- Bzed by his people. He would go through with it, to please Ayla, but ie didn't need it. He only needed to get her home safely.  1A. Sudden gust of wind chilled Jondalar, driving away the flush of Nrmth he had felt and leaving him with a strange ambivalence. He ^E»t up and, walking away from the warmth of the small fire, took a (eep breath. It left him gasping as the desiccating, freezing air seared Bs lungs. He ducked behind his fur hood and pulled it tight around US face to allow his body heat to warm the air he breathed. Though he last thing he wanted to feel was a warm wind, he knew such bitter sold was extremely dangerous.  To the north of them the great continental glacier had dipped southd, as though straining to encompass the beautiful icy mountains Whin its overwhelming frozen embrace. They were in the most frigid hid on earth, between the glistening mountain tors and the immense lorthem ice, and it was the depths of winter. The air itself was sucked "y by the moisture-stealing glaciers greedily usurping every drop to Increase their bloated, bedrock-crushing mass, building up reserves to Withstand the onslaught of summer heat.  The battle between glacial cold and melting warmth for control of  the Great Mother Earth was almost at a standstill, but the tide was turning; the glacier was gaining. It would make one more advance, and reach its farthest southward point, before it was beaten back to polar lands. But even there, it would only bide its time.    As they continued to mount the highland, each moment seemed colder than the one before. Their increasing altitude was bringing them inexorably closer to their rendezvous with ice. Fodder was getting harder for the horses to find. The sere withered grass near the stream of solid ice was flat against the frozen ground. The only snow was made up of hard dry stinging grains, whipped by driving wind.  They rode silently, but after they made camp and were cuddled together warmly within their tent, they talked.  "Yorga's hair is beautiful," Ay la said, snuggling into their furs.  "Yes, it is,"Jondalar said, with honest conviction.  "I wish Iza could have seen it, or anyone from Brun's clan. They always thought my hair was so unusual, though Iza always said it was my best feature. It used to be light like hers, but it's darker now." "I love the color of your hair, Ay la, and the way it falls in waves when you wear it loose," Jondalar commented, touching a strand next to her face.  "I didn't know people of the Clan lived so far away from the peninsula." Jondalar could tell her mind was not on hair, or on anything close and personal. She was thinking about the Clan people, as he had been earlier.  "Guban looks different, though. He seems... I don't know, it's hard to explain. His brows are heavier, his nose is bigger, his face is more... out. Everything about him seems more... pronounced, more Clan, in a way. I think he is even more muscular than Brun was.  He didn't seem to notice the cold as much, either. His skin was warm to the touch even when he was lying on the frozen ground. And his heart beat faster." "Maybe they've gotten used to cold. Laduni said a lot of them live north of here, and it hardly gets warm at all up there, even in summer, Jondalar said.  "You may be right. They think alike, though. What made you tell Guban you were repaying a kinship debt to the Clan? It was the best argument you could have made." "I'm not sure. It's true, though. I do owe my life to the Clan. If they hadn't taken you in, you wouldn't be alive, and then neither would I.  "And by giving him that cave bear tooth, you could not have given  i; E im a better token. You were quick to understand their ways, Jonda- ; i» "Their ways are not so different. The Zeiandonii are careful about iHgations, too. Any obligations left unpaid when you go to the next orid can give the one you owe control over your spirit. I've heard at a few of Those Who Serve the Mother try to keep people in their ebt so they can control their spirits, but it's probably just talk. Just ccause people say things doesn't mean they're true," the man said.  j "Guban believes that his spirit and yours are now intertwined, in Us life and the next. A piece of your spirit will always be with him, let as a piece of his will always be with you. That's why he was so Micemed. He lost his piece when you saved his life, but you gave him Be back, so there is no hole, no emptiness." "I wasn't the only one who saved his life. You did as much as I did, nd more." "But I am a woman, and a woman of the Clan is not the same as a lan of the Clan. It is not an even exchange because one cannot do fba.t the other does. They don't have the memories for it." "But you set his leg and fixed it so he could get back." "He would have gotten back; I wasn't worried about that. I was fraid his leg wouldn't heal right. Then he wouldn't be able to hunt." "Is it so bad not to hunt? Couldn't he do something else? Like those 'Armunai boys?" "The status of a Clan man depends on his ability to hunt, and his atus means more to him than his life. Guban has responsibilities. He as two women at his hearth. His first woman has two daughters, and orga is pregnant. He promised to care for all of them." "What if he can't?" Jondalar asked. "What will happen to them?" "They wouldn't starve, his clan would take care of them, but their atus—the way they live, their food and clothes, the respect they are lown—depends on his status. And he would lose Yorga. She's young id beautiful, another man would be glad to take her, but if she has ie son Guban has always wanted, she would take him with her." "What happens when he gets too old to hunt?" "An old man can give up hunting slowly, gracefully. He would go »live with the sons of his mate, or the daughters if they were still ving with the same clan, and he wouldn't be a burden on the whole 'an. Zoug developed his skill with a sling so he could still contribute, id even Dorv's advice was still valued, though he could hardly see.  ut Guban is a man in his prime, and a leader. To lose it all at once 'ould take the heart out of him." Jondalar nodded. "I think I understand. Not hunting wouldn't bother me so much. I would hate it, though, if something happened to me so that I couldn't work the flint any more." He paused to reflect then said, "You did a lot for him, Ayla. Even if Clan women are different, shouldn't that count for something? Couldn't he at least acknowledge it?" "Guban expressed his gratitude to me, Jondalar, but it was subtle as it had to be." "It must have been subtle. I didn't see it," Jondalar said, looking surprised.  "He communicated directly to me, not through you, and he paid attention to my opinions. He allowed his woman to speak to you which acknowledged me as her equal, and since he has a very high status, so was hers. He thought very highly of you, you know. Paid you a compliment." "He did?" "He thought your tools were well made and he admired your workmanship.  If he hadn't, he would not have accepted the walking sticks, or your token," Ayla explained.  "What would he have done? I accepted his tooth. I thought it was a strange gift, but I understood his meaning. I would have accepted his token, no matter what it was." "If he had felt it was not appropriate, he would have refused it, but that token was more than a gift. He accepted a serious obligation. If he did not respect you, he would not have accepted your spirit piece in exchange for his; he values his too much. He would rather have an emptiness, a hole, than accept a piece of an unworthy spirit." "You're right. There are many subtleties to those Clan people, shades of meaning within shades of meaning. I don't know if I'd ever be able to sort it all out," Jondalar said.  "Do you think the Others are any different? I still have trouble understanding all the shades within shades," Ayla said, "but your people are more tolerant. Your people do more visiting, more traveling than the Clan, and they are more used to strangers. I'm sure I've made mistakes, but I think your people have overlooked them because I'm a visitor and they realize the customs of my people may be different.  "Ayla, my people are your people, too," Jondalar said, gently.  She looked at him as if she didn't quite understand him at first.  Then she said, "I hope so, Jondalar. I hope so." The spruce and fir trees were thinning out and becoming stunted a the travelers climbed, but even though they could see past the vegetation, their route along the river took them beside outcrops and throug ;ep valleys that blocked their view of the heights around them. At a ;nd in the river, an upland stream fell into the Middle Mother, which self came from higher ground. The marrow-chilling air had caught id stilled the waters in the act of falling, and the strong dry winds id sculpted them into strange and grotesque shapes. Caricatures of nas creatures captured by frost, poised to begin a headlong flight >wn the course of the long river, seemed to be waiting impatiently, if knowing the turning of the season, and their release, was not far T.  The man and woman led the horses carefully over the jumbled bro- 31 ice, and around to the higher ground of the frozen waterfall, then opped, spellbound, as the massive plateau glacier loomed into view.  hey had caught glimpses of it before; now it seemed close enough to uch, but the stunning effect was misleading. The majestic, brooding e with its nearly level top was farther away than it seemed.  The frozen stream beside them was unmoving, but their eyes fol- wed its tortuous route as it twisted and turned, then ducked out of eht. It reappeared higher up, along with several other narrow chan- ils spaced at irregular intervals that leaked off the glacier like a hand- 1 of silvery ribbons trimming the massive cap of ice. Far mountains id nearer ridges framed the plateau with their rugged, sharp-edged, ozen tops, so starkly white their undertones of glacial blue seemed ily to reflect the clear deep hue of the sky.  The twin high peaks to the south, which for a while had accom- mied their recent travels, had long since passed from view. A new gh pinnacle that had appeared farther west was receding to the east, id the summits of the southern range that had traced their path still towed their glistening crowns.  To the north were dual ridges of more ancient rock, but the massif at had formed the northern edge of the river valley had been left ihind at the bend where the river turned back from its most northern )int, before the place where they had met the people of the Clan. The ver was closer to the new highland of limestone that had taken over ; the northern boundary as they climbed southwest, toward the river's iiirce.  The vegetation continued to change as they ascended. Spruce and Iver fir gave ground to larch and pine on the acid soils that thinly wered the impervious bedrock, but these were not the stately senti- ;ls of lower elevations. They had reached a patch of mountainous iga, stunted evergreens whose crowns held a covering of hard-packed >ow and ice that was cemented to the branches for most of the year.  hough quite dense in places, any shoot brave enough to project above the others was quickly pruned by wind and frost, which reduced the tops of all the trees to a common level.  Small animals moved freely along beaten tracks they had made be neath the trees, but large game forged trails by main force. Jondalar decided to veer away from the unnamed small stream they had been following, one of many that would eventually form the beginning of a great river, and take a game trail through the thick fringe of dwarfed conifers.  As they approached the timberline, the trees thinned out and they could see the region beyond that was completely bereft of upright woody growths. But life is tenacious. Low-growing shrubs and herbs, and extensive fields of grassy turf, partly buried under a blanket of snow, still flourished.  Though much more expansive, similar regions existed in the low elevations of the northern continents. Relict areas of temperate decid uous trees were maintained in certain protected areas and at the lower latitudes, with hardier needled evergreens appearing in the boreal re gions to the north of them. Farther north, where they existed at all, trees were usually dwarfed and stunted. Because of the extensive gla ciers, the counterparts of the high meadows that surrounded the per petual ice of the mountains were the vast steppes and tundras, where only those plants that could complete their life cycles quickly survived.  Above the timberline many hardy plants adapted to the harshness of the environment. Ayla, leading her mare, noticed the changes with interest, and she wished she had more time to examine the differences.  The mountains in the region where she had grown up were much farther south, and because of the warming influence of the inland sea, the vegetation was primarily of the cold temperate variety. The plants that existed in the higher elevations of the bitterly cold arid regions were fascinating to her.  Stately willows, which graced nearly every river, stream, or brook that sustained even a trace of moisture, grew as low shrubs, and tall sturdy birches and pines became prostrate woody growths that crawled along the ground. Blueberries and bilberries spread out as thick car pets, only four inches high. She wondered if, like the berries that grew near the northern glacier, they bore full-size but sweeter and wilder fruits. Though the bare skeletons of withered branches gave evidence of many plants, she didn't always know what variety they were, or how familiar plants might be different, and she wondered how the high meadows would look in warmer seasons.  Traveling in the dead of winter, Ayla and Jondalar did not see the spring and summer beauty of the highlands. No wild roses or rhodo- ;ndrons colored the landscape with blooms of pink; no crocuses or icmones, or beautiful blue gentians, or yellow narcissus were mpted to brave the harsh wind; and no primroses or violets would irst with polychrome splendor until the first warmth of spring. There ere no bellflowers, rampions, worts, groundsels, daisies, lilies, saxi- aees, pinks, monkshoods, or beautiful little edelweiss to ease the fcter cold monotony of the freezing fields of winter.  But another, more awesome sight filled their view. A dazzling for- ess of gleaming ice lay athwart their path. It blazed in the sun like a iflgnificent, many-faceted diamond. Its sheer crystalline white glowed ith luminous blue shadows that hid its flaws: the crevasses, tunnels, ives, and pockets that riddled the gigantic gem.  They had reached the glacier.  As the travelers neared the crest of the worn stump of the primordial lountain that bore the flat-topped crown of ice, they weren't even sure the narrow mountain stream beside them was still the same river that id been their companion for so long. The diminutive trail of ice was distinguishable from the many frozen little waterways waiting for ring to release their cascading flows to race down the crystalline rocks F the high plateau.  The Great Mother River they had followed all the way from her road delta where she had emptied into the inland sea, the great water- ay that had guided their steps over so much of their arduous Journey, as gone. Even the ice-locked hint of a wild little stream would soon £ left behind. The travelers would no longer have the comforting xnirity of the river to show them the way. They would have to Mitinue their Journey west by dead reckoning, with only the sun and ars to act as guides, and landmarks that Jondalar hoped he would member.  Above the high meadow, the vegetation was more intermittent.  nly algae, lichens, and mosses that were typical of rocks and scree >uld derive a struggling existence beyond the cushion plants and a w other rare species. Ay la had begun to feed the horses some of the "ass they carried for them. Without their heavy, shaggy coats and lick undercoat, neither horses nor wolf would have survived, but iture had adapted them to the cold. Lacking fur of their own, the timans had made their own adaptations. They took the furs of the limals they hunted; without them they would not have survived. But ien, without the protection of furs and fire, their ancestors would sver have come north in the first place.  Ibex, chamois, and mouflon were at home in mountain meadows, eluding those in more precipitous rugged regions, and frequented <W7 ?  higher ground, though usually not so late in the season, but horses were an anomaly at this high elevation. Even the gentler slopes of the massif did not usually encourage their kind to climb so high, but Whin- ney and Racer were sure-footed.  The horses, with their heads bent low, plodded up the incline at the base of the ice hauling supplies and brownish-black burning stones that would mean the difference between life and death for all of them. The humans, who led the horses to places they would not ordinarily go were looking for a level spot to set up a tent and make camp.  They were all weary of fighting the intense cold and sharp wind, of climbing the steep terrain. It was exhausting work. Even the wolf was content to stay close rather than to run off and explore.  "I'm so tired," Ay la said as they were trying to set up camp with gusty winds blowing. "Tired of the wind, and tired of the cold. I don't think it'll ever get warm again. I didn't know it could be so cold." Jondalar nodded, acknowledging the cold, but he knew the cold they had yet to face would be worse. He saw her glance at the great mass of ice, then look away as though she didn't want to see it, and he suspected she was concerned with more than cold.  "Are we really going to go across all that ice?" she asked, finally acknowledging her fears. "Is it possible? I don't even know how we're going to get up to the top." "It's not easy, but it's possible," Jondalar said. "Thonolan and I did it. While there is still light, I'd like to look for the best way to get the horses up there." "It feels like we've been traveling forever. How much farther do we have to go, Jondalar?" "It's still a ways to the Ninth Cave, but not too far, not near as far as we have come, and once we get across the ice, it's only a short distance to Dalanar's Cave. We'll stop there for a while; it will give you a chance to meet him, and Jerika and everyone--I can hardly wait to show Dalanar and Joplaya some of the flint-knapping techniques I learned from Wymez--but even if we stay and visit, we should be home before summer." Ayla felt distressed. Summer! But this is winter, she thought. If she had really understood how long the Journey would be, she wondered if she would have been so eager to go with Jondalar all the way back to his home. She might have tried harder to persuade him to stay with the Mamutoi.  "Let's go take a closer look at that glacier," Jondalar said, "and pla" the best way to get up on it. Then we should make sure we have everything and are ready to cross the ice." ^ "We'll have to use some of the burning stones to make a fire tonight,  yla said. "There's nothing to bum around here. And we'll have to eit ice for water... we shouldn't have any trouble finding enough ^tbat." Except for a few shaded pockets of negligible accumulation, there as no snow in the area where they camped, and there had been very ale for most of their trek up the slope. Jondalar had only been that ay once before, but the whole area seemed much drier than he re- icmbered. He was right. They were in the rain shadow of the high- dd, the back side; the sparse snows that did fall in the region usually rived a little later, after the season had begun to turn. He and Thon- an had run into a snowstorm on their way down.  During the winter, the warmer, water-laden air, riding the prevail- ig winds coming from the western ocean, rose up the slopes until it ached the large level area of cold ice with high pressure centered over > Having the effect of a giant funnel that was aimed at the high massif, be moist air cooled, condensed, and turned to snow, which fell only l the ice below, feeding the hungry maw of the demanding glacier.  The ice covering the entire worn and rounded top of the ancient assif spread the precipitation over the whole area, creating a nearly vel surface, except at the periphery. The cooled air, milked dry of pud, dropped low and raced down the sides, bringing no snow be- )hd the edges of the ice.  As Jondalar and Ayla hiked around the base of the ice looking for ie easiest way up, they noticed areas that seemed newly disturbed, ith dirt and rocks gouged up by prongs of advancing ice. The glacier as growing.  In many areas, the ancient rock of the highland was exposed at the of of the glacier. The massif, folded and uplifted by the immense essures that had created the mountains to the south, had once been solid block of crystalline granite that incorporated a similar highland i the west. The forces that pushed against the immovable old moun- in, the most ancient rock on earth, left evidence in the form of a great ft, a fault that had cleaved the block asunder.  Directly across toward the west, on the opposite side of the glacier, e massifs western slope was steep, and matched by an east-facing irallel edge across the rift valley. A river flowed along the middle of fi broad valley floor of the fault trough protected by the high parallel ies of the cracked massif. But Jondalar planned to head southwest, cross the glacier diagonally and come down a more gradual grade.  e wanted to cross the river nearer its source high in the southern ountains, before it flowed around the glaciered massif and through e rift valley.  "Where did this come from?" Ayla asked, holding up the object in question. It consisted of two oval wooden disks mounted in a frame that held them rigid and fastened fairly close together, with leather thongs attached to the outside edges. A thin slit was cut the lone way down the middle of the wooden ovals for almost the full length, nearly dividing them in half.  "I made it before we left. I have one for you, too. It's for your eyes Sometimes the glare of the ice on the glacier is so bright that you can't see anything but white--people call it snow-blind. The blindness usually goes away after a while, but your eyes can get awfully red and sore. This will protect your eyes. Go ahead, put it on," Jondalar said.  Then, seeing her rumble with them, he added, "Here, I'll show you." He put the unusual sunshields on and tied the thongs behind his head.  "How can you see?" Ayla asked. She could just barely make out his eyes behind the long horizontal slits, but she put on the pair he gave her. "You can see almost everything! You just have to turn your head to see to the side." She was surprised; then she smiled. "You look so funny with your big blank eyes, like some kind of strange spirit.  or a bug. Maybe the spirit of a bug." "You look funny, too," he said, smiling back, "but those bug eyes could save your life. You need to see where you are going up on the ice." "These mouflon-wool boot liners from Madenia's mother have been so nice to have," Ayla commented as she put them in a handy place to get at them easily. "Even when they're wet, they keep your feet warm." "We may be grateful to have the extra pair when we're on the ice, too," Jondalar said.  "I used to stuff my foot-coverings with sedge grass, when I lived with the Clan." "Sedge grass?" "Yes. It keeps your feet warm and dries fast." "That's useful to know," Jondalar said, then picked up a boot. "Wear the boots with the mammoth-hide soles. They're almost waterproof and they're tough. Sometimes ice can be sharp, and they're rough enough so you won't slip, especially on the way up. Let's see, well need the adze to chop up ice." He put the tool on top of a pile he was making. "And rope. Good strong cord, too. We'll need the tent, sleeping furs, food, of course. Can we leave some of the cooking equipment.  We won't need much on the ice, and we can get more from the Lanza- donii." "We'll be using traveling food. I won't be cooking, and I decided to  |nse the big skin pot attached to the frame that we got from Solandia to |melt the ice for water, and put it directly over the fire. It's faster that jway, and we don't have to boil the water. Just melt it," Ayla said.  "Be sure to keep a spear with you." "Why? There are no animals on the ice, are there?" "No, but you can use it to prod ahead of you to make sure the ice is Jsolid. What about this mammoth hide?"Jondalar asked. "We've carried Ibis with us ever since we started out, but do we need it? It's heavy." > "It's a good hide, nice and pliable now, and a good waterproof cover ifar the bowl boat. You said it snows on the ice." She really hated to :tfarow it away.  i "But we can use the tent as a cover." "That's true... but," Ayla said, pursing her lips, considering.  I Then she noticed something else. "Where did you get those torches?" | "From Laduni. We'll be up before sunrise and will need light to tpack. I want to reach the top of the plateau before the sun is very high, Iwhile everything is still frozen solid," Jondalar said. "Even when it's this cold, the sun can melt the ice a little and it will be difficult enough to reach the top." They went to bed early, but Ayla couldn't fall asleep. She was nervous and excited. This was the glacier that Jondalar had talked about from the beginning.    "Wha... What's wrong?" Ayla said, startled wide awake.  "Nothing's wrong. It's time to get up," Jondalar said, holding up the torch. He pushed the handle into the gravel to support it, then handed her a cup of steaming tea. "I started a fire. Here's some tea." She smiled, and he looked pleased. She had made his morning tea nearly every single day of their Journey, and he was delighted that he'd gotten up first, for once, and made tea for her. Actually, he'd never gone to sleep. He hadn't been able to. He'd been too nervous, too excited, and too worried.  Wolf watched his humans, his eyes reflecting the light. Sensing something unusual, he capered and pranced back and forth. The horses were frisky, too, full of snorting, nickering, and vibrato blowing with clouds of steam. Using the burning stones, Ayla melted ice for water and fed them grain. She gave Wolf a cake of Losadunai traveling food along with one for her and Jondalar. By the light of the torch, they packed the tent, the sleeping furs, and a few implements. They left a few odds and ends behind, an empty container of grain, a few stone tools, but at the last moment Ayla threw the mammoth hide over the brown coal in the bowl boat.  Jondalar picked up the torch to light the way. Taking Racer's lead rope, he started out, but the firelight was distracting. He could see a small lighted circle in the immediate vicinity, but not much beyond even when he held it up high. The moon was nearly full, and he began to feel he could find their way better without the fire. The man finally threw it down and walked ahead in the dark. Ayla followed, and in a few moments their eyes adjusted. Behind them the torch still burned on the graveled ground as they moved away.  In the light of a moon that lacked only a sliver from being full, the monstrous bastion of ice glowed with an eerie, evanescent light. The black sky was hazy with stars, the air brittle and crackling with cold; an amorphous ether charged with a life of its own.  As cold as it was, the freezing air had a deeper intensity as they neared the great wall of ice, but Ayla's shiver was caused by the thrill of awe and anticipation. Jondalar watched her glowing eyes, her slightly open mouth as she took deeper, faster breaths. He was always aroused by her excitement, and he felt a stirring in his loins. But he shook his head. There was no time now. The glacier was waiting.  Jondalar took a long rope out of his pack. "We need to tie ourselves together," he said.  "The horses, too?" "No. We might be able to support each other, but if the horses slip, they'll take us with them." As much as he would hate to lose either Racer or Whinney, it was Ayla he was most concerned about.  Ayla frowned, but she nodded her agreement.  They spoke in hushed whispers, the silent brooding ice quieting their voices. They didn't want to disturb its hulking splendor or warn it of their impending assault.  Jondalar tied one end of the rope around his waist and the other end around Ayla, coiling up the slack and putting his arm through to carry it on his shoulder. Then each of them picked up the lead rope of a horse. Wolf would have to make his own way.  Jondalar felt a moment of panic before he started. What could he have been thinking of? What ever made him think he could bring Ayla and the horses across the glacier? They should have gone the long way around. Even if it took longer, it was safer. At least they would have made it. Then he stepped on the ice.  At the foot of a glacier there was often a separation between the ice and the land, which created a cavelike space beneath the ice, or an overhanging ice shelf that extended out over the accumulated gravels of glacial till. At the place Jondalar chose to start, the overhang had collapsed, providing a gradual ascent. It was also mixed with gravel,  ^giving them better footing. Starting from the collapsed edge a heavy I accumulation of gravel--a moraine--led up the side of the ice like a Iwell-defined trail and, except near the top, it did not appear too steep Jfor them or the sure-footed horses. Getting over the top edge could be |a problem, but he wouldn't know how much of one until he got there.  t- With Jondalar leading the way, they started up the slope. Racer Ifcalked for a moment. Although they had trimmed it down, his large load was still unwieldy and the shift in elevation from a moderate to a i Steeper grade unsettled him. A hoof slipped, then caught hold, and '.With some hesitation the young stallion started up. Then it was Ayla's turn, and Whinney dragging the travois. But the mare had hauled the pole drag for so long, across such varied terrain, that she was accustomed to it, and, unlike the large load Racer carried on his back, the wide-spaced poles helped to steady the mare.  Wolf brought up the rear. It was easier for him. He was lower to the ground and his callused paws provided friction against slipping. But fhe sensed the danger to his companions and followed behind as though guarding the rear, watchful for some unseen menace.  In the bright moonlight, reflections from jagged outcrops of bare ice shimmered, and the mirrorlike surfaces of sheer planes had a deep liquid quality, like still black pools. It was not difficult to see the moraine that was spilling down, like a river of sand and stones in slow motion, but the night lighting obscured the size and perspective of objects and hid small details.  Jondalar set a slow and cautious pace, carefully leading his horse around obstructions. Ayla was more concerned with finding the best path for the horse she was leading than she was for her own safety. As the slope became steeper, the horses, unbalanced by the sharper incline and their heavy loads, struggled for footing. When ajioof slipped as Jondalar tried to lead Racer up a precipitous rise near the top, the horse neighed and tried to rear.  "Come on. Racer," Jondalar urged, pulling his lead rope taut, as if he could pull him up by sheer brute strength. "We're almost there, you can do it." The stallion made an effort, but his hooves slipped on treacherous ice below a thin layer of snow, and Jondalar felt himself pulled back by the lead rope. He eased up on the rope, giving Racer his head, and finally let go altogether. There were things in the pack he would hate to lose, and even more, it would pain him to lose the animal, but he feared the stallion could not make it.  But when his hooves found gravel. Racer's slide stopped, and with no restraint on him, he lifted his head and plunged forward. Suddenly  the stallion was over the edge, adroitly stepping over a narrow crack at the end of a crevasse as the way leveled out. Jondalar noticed that the color of the sky had shifted from black to deep indigo blue, with a faint lightening of the shade on the eastern horizon, as he stroked the horse and praised him warmly.  Then he felt a tug on the rope over his shoulder. Ayla must have slipped back, he thought, as he gave her more slack. She must have reached the steep rise. Suddenly the rope was slipping through his hand, until he felt a strong tug at his waist. She must be holding on to Whinney's lead rope, he thought. She's got to let go.  He grabbed the rope with both hands and shouted, "Let go, Ayla!  She'll pull you down with her!" But Ayla didn't hear, or if she did, she didn't comprehend. Whinney had started up the incline, but her hooves could find no purchase and she kept slipping back. Ayla was holding on to the lead rope, as though she could keep the mare from falling, but she was sliding back, too.  Jondalar felt himself being pulled dangerously close to the edge. Looking for something to hold on to, he grabbed Racer's lead rope. The stallion neighed.  But it was the travois that checked Whinney's descent. One of the poles caught in a crack and held long enough for the mare to get her balance. Then her hooves plunged through a snowdrift that held her steady, and she found gravel. As he felt the pull ease, he let go of Racer's lead. Bracing his foot against the crack in the ice, Jondalar pulled up on the rope around his waist.  "Give me a little slack," Ayla called out, as she held on to the lead rope while Whinney pushed forward.  Suddenly, miraculously, he saw Ayla over the edge, and he pulled her the rest of the way. Then Whinney appeared. With a forward vault, she scrambled up past the crack and her feet were on the level ice, the poles of the travois jutting out into the air and the bowl boat resting on the edge they had surmounted. A streak of pink appeared across the early morning sky, defining the edge of the earth, as Jondalar heaved a great sigh.  Wolf suddenly bounded up over the edge and raced over to Ayla.  He started to jump up on her, but, feeling none too steady, she signaled him down. He backed off, looked at Jondalar and then the horses. Lifting his head and starting with a few preliminary yips, he howled his wolf song loud and long.  Although they had climbed up a steep incline and the ice had leveled out, they were not quite on the top surface of the glacier. There were cracks near the edge, and broken blocks of expanded ice that had surged up. Jondalar crossed a mound of snow that covered a jagg^'  splintered pile behind the edge, and finally he set his feet on a level Surface of the ice plateau. Racer followed him, sending broken chunks bouncing and rolling in a clattering fall over the edge. The man kept flie rope attached to his waist taut as Ay la traced over his last steps.  Wolf raced ahead while Whinney followed behind.  ; The sky had become a fleeting and unique shade of dawn blue, while coruscating rays of light radiated from just behind the edge of the ^arth. Ayla looked back over the steep incline and wondered how they |had made it up the slope. From their vantage point at the top, it didn't ifcok possible. Then she turned to go on, and she caught her breath.  J The rising sun had peeked over the eastern edge with a blinding Iburst of light that illuminated an incredible scene. To the west, a flat, I utterly featureless, dazzling white plain stretched out before them.  I Above it the sky was a shade of blue she had never seen in her life. It t had somehow absorbed the reflection of the red dawn, and the blue- ( green undertone of glacial ice, and yet remained blue. But it was a blue so stunningly brilliant that it seemed to glow with its own light in a color beyond description. It shaded to a hazy blue-black on the distant horizon in the southwest.  As the sun rose in the east, the faded image of a slightly less than perfect circle that had glowed with such brilliant reflection in the black sky of their predawn awakening hovered over the far western edge; a dim memory of its earlier glory. But nothing interrupted the unearthly splendor of the vast desert of frozen water; no tree, no rock, no movement of any kind marred the majesty of the seemingly unbroken surface.    Ayla expelled her breath explosively. She hadn't known she was holding it. "Jondalar! It's magnificent! Why didn't you tell me? I would have journeyed twice the distance just to see this," she said in an awed voice.  "It is spectacular," he said, smiling at her reaction, but just as overwhelmed.  "But I couldn't tell you. I've never seen it like this before.  It's not often this still. The blizzards up here can be spectacular, too.  Let's move while we can see the way. It's not as solid as it seems, and with this clear sky and the bright sun, a crevasse could open up or an overhanging cornice give way." They started across the plain of ice, preceded by their long shadows.  Before the sun was very high, they were sweating in their heavy clothes. Ayla started to remove her hooded outer fur parka.  "Take it off, if you want," Jondalar said, "but keep yourself covered.  You can get a bad sunburn up here, and not just from above. When the sun shines on it, the ice can burn you, too."  Small cumulus clouds began to form during the morning. By noon they had drawn together into large cumulus clouds. The wind started picking up in the afternoon. About the time Ayla andjondalar decided to stop to melt snow and ice for water, she was more than happy to put her warm outer fur back on. The sun was hidden by moisture- laden cumulonimbus that sprinkled a light dusting of dry powder snow on the travelers. The glacier was growing.  The plateau glacier they were crossing had been spawned in the peaks of the craggy mountains far to the south. Moist air, rising as it swept up the tall barriers, condensed into misty droplets, but temperature decided whether it would fall as cold rain or, with just a slight drop, as snow. It was not perpetual freezing that made glaciers; rather an accumulation of snow from one year to the next gave rise to glaciers that, in time, became sheets of ice that eventually spanned continents.  In spite of a few hot days, solid cold winters in combination with cool cloudy summers that don't quite melt the leftover snow and ice at winter's end--a lower yearly average temperature--will swing the balance toward a glacial epoch.  Just below the soaring spires of the southern mountains, too steep themselves for snow to rest upon, small basins formed, cirques that nestled against the sides of the pinnacles; and these cirques were the birthplaces of glaciers. As the light, dry, lacy snowflakes drifted into the depressions high in the mountains, created by minute amounts of water freezing in cracks and then expanding to loosen tons of rock, they piled up. Eventually the weight of the mass of frozen water broke the delicate flakes into pieces that coalesced into small round balls of ice: fim, corn snow.  Fim did not form at the surface, but deep in the cirque, and when more snow fell, the heavier compact spheres were pushed up and over the edge of the nest. As more of them accumulated, the nearly circular balls of ice were pressed together so hard by the sheer weight above that a fraction of the energy was released as heat. For just an instant, they melted at the many points of contact and immediately refroze, welding the balls together. As the layers of ice deepened, the greater pressure rearranged the structure of the molecules into solid, crystalline ice, but with a subtle difference: the ice flowed.  Glacier ice, formed under tremendous pressure, was more dense; yet at the lower levels the great mass of solid ice flowed as smoothly as any liquid. Separating around obstructions, such as the soaring tops of mountains, and rejoining on the other side--often taking a large part of the rock with it and leaving behind sharp-peaked islands--a glacier followed the contours of the land, grinding and reshaping it as it went.  I The river of solid ice had currents and eddies, stagnant pools and ing centers, but it moved to a different time, as ponderously ' as it was massively huge. It could take years to move inches. But ; didn't matter. It had all the time in the world. As long as the age temperature stayed below the critical line, the glacier fed and ^.  Mountain cirques were not the only birthplaces. Glaciers formed on vel ground, too, and once they covered a large enough area, the tilling effect spread the precipitation out of the anticyclone runnel, altered in the middle, to the extreme margins; the thickness of the ice mained nearly the same throughout.  Glaciers were never entirely dry. Some water was always seeping )wn from the melting caused by pressure. It filled in small cracks and armies, and when it chilled and refroze, it expanded in all directions.  he motion of a glacier was outward in all directions from its origin, id the speed of its motion depended on the slope of its surface, not i the slope of the ground underneath. If the surface slope was great, ie water within the glacier flowed downhill faster through the chinks Kin the ice and spread out the ice as it refroze. They grew faster when ||hey were young, near large oceans or seas, or in mountains where the Jhigh peaks assured heavy snowfall. They slowed down after they ^spread out, their broad surface reflecting the sunlight away and the air tabove the center turning colder and drier with less snow.  I The glaciers in the mountains to the south had spread out from their high peaks, filled the valleys to the level of high mountain passes, and spilled through them. During an earlier advancing period, the moun- | tain glaciers filled the deep trench of a fault line separating the moun- | tain foreland and the ancient massif. It covered the highland, then | spread across to the old eroded mountains on the northern fringe. The ; ice receded during the temporary warming--which was coming to an | end--and melted in the lowland fault valley, creating a large river and ; a long, moraine-dammed lake, but the plateau glacier on the highland > they were crossing stayed frozen.    ', They could not build a fire directly on the ice and had planned to ; use the bowl boat as a base for the river stones they had brought to build the fire on. But first they had to empty all the burning stones out of the round craft. As Ay la picked up the heavy mammoth hide, it occurred to her that they could just as well use it as a base upon which to build a fire. Even if it scorched a little, it wouldn't matter. It pleased her that she had thought to bring it. Everyone, including the horses, had water and a little food.  While they were stopped, the sun disappeared entirely behind heavy clouds, and before they started on their way again, thick snow beean falling with grim determination. The north wind howled across the icy expanse; there was nothing on the whole vast sheet covering the massif to stand in its way. A blizzard was in the making. A ,s the snowfall thickened, the force of the wind from the northwest suddenly increased. It slammed into them with a blast of cold air that shoved them along as though they were no more than an insignificant piece of the horizontal curtain of white that surrounded | them.  | "I think we'd better wait this out," Jondalar shouted to be heard ' above the howl.  | They fought to set up their tent while the icy blasts seized the small ; shelter, tore the stakes out of the ice, and left the tent billowing and napping. The violent, sinewy wind threatened to rip the sheet of leather from the grasp of the two puny living souls trying to make their way across the ice, daring to present an obstacle to the furious, snow- choked blizzard raging across the flat surface.  "How are we going to keep the tent down?" Ayla asked. "Is it always this bad up here?" "I don't remember it blowing this hard before, but I'm not surprised." The horses were standing mutely, their heads down, stoically enduring the storm. Wolf was close beside them, digging out a hole for himself. "Maybe we could get one of the horses to stand on the loose end and hold it down until we get it staked," Ayla suggested.  With one thing leading to another, they came up with a makeshift solution, using the horses as both stakes and tent supports. They draped the leather tent over the backs of both horses, then Ayla coaxed Whinney to stand on one of the edges, turned under, hoping the mare wouldn't shift too much and let it up. Ayla and Jondalar huddled together, with the wolf under their bent knees, sitting, almost under the bellies of the horses, on the other end of the tent that was wrapped around underneath them.  It was dark before the squall blew itself out, and they had to camp for the night at the same place, but they set the tent up properly first.  In the morning, Ayla was puzzled by some dark stains near the edge of the tent that Whinney had stood on. She wondered about them as they hurried to break camp early the next morning.  They made more progress the second day, in spite of climbing over pressure mounds of broken ice and working their way around an area of several yawning cracks, all oriented in the same direction. A storm blew up in the afternoon again, though the wind was not as strong and it blew over more quickly, allowing them to continue their Journey during the late afternoon.  Toward evening, Ayla noticed that Whinney was limping. She felt her heart beat faster and a rush of fear when she looked closer and saw red smudges on the ice. She picked up Whinney's foot and examined her hoof. It was cut to the quick and bleeding.  "Jondalar, look at this. Her feet are all cut up. What did that to her?" Ayla said.  He looked, and then he examined Racer's hooves while Ayla was looking at the rest of Whinney's. He found the same kind of injuries, then frowned. "It must be the ice," he said. "You'd better check Wolf, too." The pads of the wolfs paws showed damage, though not quite as bad as the horses' hooves. "What are we going to do?" Ayla said.  "They're crippled, or will be soon." "It never occurred to me that the ice could be so sharp it could cut up their hooves," Jondalar said, very upset. "I tried to think of everything, but I didn't think about that." He was stricken with remorse.  "Hooves are hard, but they're not like stone. More like fingernails.  They can be damaged. Jondalar, they can't go on. They'll be so crippled in another day that they won't be able to walk at all," Ayla said.  "We've got to help them." "But what can we do?" Jondalar said.  "Well, I still have my medicine bag. I can treat their injuries." "But we can't stay here until they're healed. And as soon as they start walking again, it will be just as bad." The man stopped and closed his eyes. He didn't even want to think what he was thinking, much less say it, but he could see only one way out of their dilemma. "Ayla, we're going to have to leave them," the man said, as gently as he could.  "Leave them? What do you mean, 'leave them'? We can't leave Whinney, or Racer. Where would they find water? Or food? There s nothing to graze on the ice, not even twig tips. They'd starve, or freeze.  We can't do that!" Ayla said, her face showing her distress. "We can't leave them here like that! We can't, Jondalar!" "You're right, we can't leave them here like that. It wouldn't be fair.  They would suffer too much... but... we do have spears and the spear-throwers..."Jondalar said.  "No! No!" Ayla screamed. "I won't let you!"  "It would be better than leaving them here to die slowly, to suffer.  :'s not like horses haven't been... hunted before. That's what most eople do." "But these aren't like other horses. Whinney and Racer are friends.  /e've been through so much together. They've helped us. Whinney ived my life. I can't leave her." "I don't want to leave them any more than you do," Jondalar said, init what else can we do?" The idea of killing the stallion after traveling so far together was almost more than he could bear, and he knew Ibow Ayla felt about Whinney.  I "We'll go back. We'll just have to turn back. You said there was lanother way around!" I "We've already traveled two days on this ice, and the horses are j'rimost crippled. We can try to go back, Ayla, but I don't think they I will make it," Jondalar said. He wasn't even sure if Wolf would be able ^to make it. Guilt and remorse filled him. "I'm sorry, Ayla. It's my 'fault. It was stupid of me to think we could cross this glacier with the horses. We should have gone the long way around, but I'm afraid it's too late now." Ayla saw tears in his eyes. She had not often seen him in tears.  Though it was not so unusual for men of the Others to cry, it was his nature to hide those emotions. In a way, it made his love for her more intense. He had given of himself, almost completely, only to her, and she loved him for it, but she could not give up Whinney. The horse was her friend; the only friend she had had in the valley, until Jondalar came.  "We've got to do something, Jondalar!" she sobbed.  "But what?" He had never felt so desolate, so totally frustrated at his inability to find some solution.  "Well, for now," Ayla said, wiping her eyes, her tears freezing on her face, "I'm going to treat their injuries. I can do that much, anyway." She got out her otter-skin medicine bag. "We'll have to make a good fire, hot enough to boil water, not just melt ice." She took the mammoth hide off the brown burning stones and spread it out on the ice. She noticed some scorch marks on the supple leather, but they hadn't damaged the tough old hide. She put the river rocks on a different spot, but near the middle, as a base upon which to build a fire. At least they didn't have to worry about conserving fuel any more. They could leave most of it behind.  She didn't talk, she couldn't, and Jondalar had nothing to say either.  It seemed impossible. All the thought, planning, and preparation that had gone into the trek across this glacier, only to be stopped by some-  thing they hadn't even considered. Ayla stared at the small fire. Wolf crawled up to her and whined, not in pain, but because he knew something was wrong. Ayla checked his paws again. They weren't as bad. He had more control over where he put his feet, and he carefully licked off snow and ice when they stopped to rest. She didn't want to think about losing him, either.  She hadn't consciously thought of Durc for some time, though he was always there, a memory, a cold pain that she would never forget.  She found herself musing about him. Has he started to hunt with the clan, yet? Has he learned to use a sling? Uba would be a good mother to him, she would take care of him, make his food, make him warm winter clothes.  Ayla shivered, thinking about the cold, then thought about the first winter clothes Iza had made for her. She had loved the rabbit skin hat with the fur worn on the inside. The winter foot-coverings had fur inside too. She recalled stomping around in a pair of new ones, and she remembered how the simple foot-coverings were made. It was just a piece of hide, gathered up and tied at the ankle. They conformed to the shape of the foot after a while, though at first they were rather clumsy, but that was part of the fun of new ones.  Ayla kept staring at the fire, watching the water start to simmer.  Something was nagging her. Something important, she was sure.  Something about.  Suddenly she drew in her breath. "Jondalar! Oh, Jondalar!" She seemed agitated to him. "What's the matter, Ayla?" "It's not what's wrong, it's what's right," she cried. "I just remembered something!" He thought she was acting strangely. "I don't understand," he said.  He wondered if the thought of losing her two horses was too much for her. She pulled at the heavy tarp of mammoth hide under the fire, knocking a hot coal directly onto the leather.  "Give me a knife, Jondalar. Your sharpest knife." "My knife?" he said.  "Yes, your knife," she said. "I'm going to make boots for the horses!" "You're going to do what?" "I'm going to make boots for the horses, and Wolf, too. Out of this mammoth hide!" "How do you make horse boots?" "I'll cut circles out of the mammoth leather, then cut holes around the edges, thread some cord through, and tie it around the horses ankles. If mammoth hide can keep our feet from getting cut up by the ice, it's bound to protect theirs," Ayla explained.  Tondalar thought for a moment, visualizing what she described; then > smiled. "Ayla! I think it will work. By the Great Mother, I think it ill work! What a wonderful idea! Whatever made you think of it?" ."That's the way Iza made boots for me. That's how the people of g Clan make foot-coverings. Hand-coverings, too. I'm trying to re- gmber if that's the kind Guban and Yorga wore. It's hard to tell, ecause after a while they shape to your feet." "Will that hide be enough?" | "It should be. While I've got the fire going, I'll finish preparing this nedy for the cuts, and maybe some hot tea for us. We haven't had f for a couple of days, and we probably won't again until we get wn off this ice. We're going to have to conserve fuel, but I think a i of hot tea would taste very good right now." "I think you're right!" Jondalar agreed, smiling again and feeling ood.  Ayla very carefully examined each hoof on both horses, trimmed i»way the rough places, applied her medication, then tied the Bianunoth-hide horse boots on them. They tried to shake off the Strange foot-coverings at first, but they were tied on securely, and Stfae horses quickly got used to them. Then she took the set she had '.made for Wolf and tied them on. He chewed and gnawed at them, trying to get rid of the unfamiliar encumbrances, but after a while he s stopped fighting them, too. His oversize wolf feet were in much better shape.  The next morning they loaded a slightly lighter pack on the horses; I they had burned some of the brown coal, and the heavy mammoth | hide was now on their feet. Ayla unloaded them when they stopped I for a rest, and she took on a little more of the load herself. But she | couldn't begin to carry what the sturdy horses could. In spite of trav- | eling, their hooves and feet seemed much improved by that night.  ^Wolfs seemed perfectly normal, which was a great relief for both Ayla |; and Jondalar. The boots provided an unexpected benefit: they acted as a kind of snowshoe when there was deep snow, and the large, heavy ; animals didn't sink in as far.  ; The pattern of the first day held, with some variation. They made their best time in the morning; the afternoons brought snow and wind , of varying intensity. Sometimes they were able to travel a little farther i after the storm, other times they had to stay where they stopped in the afternoon through the night, and on one occasion for two days, but none of the blizzards were as fierce as the one they had encountered the first day.  The surface of the glacier wasn't quite as flat and smooth as it had  appeared on that first glistening day in the sun. They floundered through deep drifts of soft powdered snow piled high from localized snowstorms. Other times, where driving winds cleared the surface they crunched over sharp projections and slid into shallow ditches their feet catching in narrow spaces and their ankles twisting under them on the uneven surface. Instant squalls blew down without warning, the fierce winds almost never let up, and they felt constant anxiety about unseen crevasses covered over with flimsy bridges or overhanging cornices of snow.  They detoured around open cracks, especially near the center where the dry air held so little moisture that the snows were not heavy enough to fill the crevasses. And the cold, the deep, bitter, bone- chilling cold, never let up. Their breath froze on the fur of their hoods around their mouths; a drop of water spilling from a cup was frozen before it touched the ground. Their faces, exposed to raw winds and bright sun, cracked, peeled, and blackened. Frostbite was a constant threat.  The strain was beginning to tell. Their responses were beginning to deteriorate, and so was their judgment. A furious afternoon storm had held on into the night. In the morning, Jondalar was anxious to get under way. They had lost much more time than he had planned. In the bitter cold, it took longer for the water to heat, and their supply of burning stones was dwindling.  Ayla was going through her backpack; then she began searching around her sleeping fur. She couldn't remember how many days they had been on the ice, but as far as she was concerned, it was too many, she thought as she searched.  "Hurry up, Ayla! What's taking you so long?" Jondalar snapped, "I can't find my eye protectors," she said.  "I told you not to lose them. Do you want to go blind?" he exploded.  "No, I don't want to go blind. Why do you think I'm looking for them?" Ayla retorted. Jondalar snatched her fur up and shook it vigorously.  The wooden goggles fell to the ground.  "Be careful where you put them next time," he said. "Now let's get moving." They quickly packed up their camp, but Ayla sulked and refused to talk to Jondalar. He came over and double-checked her lashings, as he usually did. Ayla grabbed Whinney's rope and started out taking the lead, moving the horse away before Jondalar could examine her pack.  "Don't you think I know how to pack a horse myself? You said you wanted to get moving. Why are you wasting time?" she flung back over her shoulder.  He had just been trying to be careful, Jondalar thought angrily. She doesn't even know the way. Wait until she wanders around in circles for a while. Then she will come asking me to lead, he thought, falling tin behind her.  Ayla was cold and fatigued from the grueling march. She plunged tahead, careless of her surroundings. If he wants to hurry so much, ^then we'll hurry, she thought. If we ever get to the end of this ice, I ifaope I never see a glacier again.  » Wolf was nervously racing between Ayla in the lead and Jondalar I following behind. He didn't like the sudden change in their positions.  ^The tall man had always started out ahead before. The wolf struck out I ahead of the woman, who was trudging blindly on, oblivious to every- | thing except the miserable cold and her injured feelings. Suddenly he I stopped directly in front of her, blocking her way.  , Ayla, leading the mare, went around him. He ran back around and stopped in front of her again. She ignored him. He nudged at her legs; she shoved him aside. He ran ahead a short distance, then sat down whining to get her attention. She plodded past him. He raced back toward Jondalar, pranced and whined in front of him, then bounded a few steps toward Ayla, whining, then advanced toward the man once more.  "Is something wrong, Wolf?" Jondalar said, finally noticing the animal's agitation.  Suddenly he heard a terrifying sound, a muffled boom. His head shot up as fountains of light snow filled the air ahead.  "No! Oh no!" Jondalar cried out in anguish, running forward. When the snow settled, a lone animal stood on the brink of a yawning crack.  Wolf pointed his nose straight up and wailed a long, desolate howl.  Jondalar threw himself flat on the ice at the edge of the crevasse and looked over the edge. "Ayla!" he cried in desperation. "Ayla!" His stomach was a hard knot. He knew it was useless. She would never hear him. She was dead, at the bottom of the deep crack in the ice.  "Jondalar?" He heard a small frightened voice coming from far away.  "Ayla?" He felt a rush of hope and looked down. Far below him, standing on a narrow ice ledge that hugged the wall of the deep trench, was the terrified woman. "Ayla, don't move!" he commanded. "Stand perfectly still. That ledge could go, too." She's alive, he thought. I can't believe it. It's a miracle. But how am I going to get her out?  Inside the icy chasm, Ayla leaned in toward the wall, clinging desperately to a crack and a projecting piece, petrified with fear. She had  been plodding through snow halfway to her knees, lost in her own thoughts. She was tired, so tired of it all: tired of the cold, tired of fighting her way through deep snow, tired of the glacier. The trek across the ice had drained her energy, and she was bone-weary with exhaustion. Though she struggled on, her only thought was to reach the end of the massive glacier.  Then she was startled out of her brooding thoughts by a loud crack She felt the sickening sensation of the solid ice giving way beneath her feet, and she was suddenly reminded of an earthquake many years before. Instinctively she tried to reach for something to hold on to, but the falling ice and snow offered nothing. She felt herself dropping nearly suffocating in the midst of the avalanching snow bridge that had collapsed beneath her feet, and she had no idea how she had ended up on the narrow ledge.  She looked up, afraid to move even that much, for fear the slightest shift in weight would jar her precarious support loose. Above, the sky looked almost black, and she thought she saw the faint glimmerings of stars. An occasional sliver of ice or puff of snow dropped belatedly from the edge, finally letting go of its precarious hold and showering the woman with fragments on the way down.  Her ledge was a narrow jutting extension of an older surface long buried by new snows. It rested on a large jagged boulder that had been torn from solid rock as the ice slowly filled a valley and overflowed down the sides of an adjacent one. The majestically flowing river of ice accumulated great quantities of dust, sand, gravel, and boulders that it gouged out of hard rock, which were slowly carried toward the faster- moving current at the center. These moraines formed long ribbons of rubble on the surface as they moved along the current. When the temperature eventually rose enough to melt the massive glaciers, they would leave evidence of their passage in ridges and hills of unsorted rock.  While she was waiting, afraid to move and holding herself very still, she heard faint mutterings and muted rumblings in the deep icy cavern.  She thought at first that she imagined them. But the mass of ice was not as solid as it seemed on the hard surface above. It was constantly readjusting, expanding, shifting, sliding. The explosive boom of a new crack opening or closing at some distant point, on the surface or deep within the glacier, sent vibrations through the strangely viscous solid. The great mountain of ice was riddled with catacombs: passages that came to an abrupt halt, long galleries that turned and twisted, dropped off or soared upward; pockets and caves that opened invitingly, then sealed shut.  Ayla began to look around her. The sheer walls of ice glowed with a  luminous, unbelievably rich blue light that had a deep undertone of green. With a sudden jolt, she realized she had seen that color before, but in only one other place. Jondalar's eyes were the same rich, stuning blue! She longed to see them again. The fractured planes of the | huge ice crystal gave her the sensation of mysterious flitting movement SWSC beyond her peripheral vision. She felt that if she turned her head quickly enough she would see some ephemeral shape disappearing into Kthe mirrored walls.  ;.. But it was all illusion, a magician's trick of angles and light. The crystal ice filtered out most of the red spectrum of the light from the Iburning orb in the sky, leaving the deep blue-green, and the edges and planes of the tinted, mirrored surfaces played games of refraction and reflection with each other.  Ayla glanced up when she felt a shower of snow. She saw Jondalar's head extending beyond the rim of the crevasse, then a length of rope came snaking down toward her.  "Tie the rope around your waist, Ayla," he called, "and make sure you tie it well. Let me know when you're ready." He was doing it again, Jondalar said to himself. Why did he always recheck what she did when he knew she was more than capable of doing it herself? Why did he tell her to do something that was perfectly obvious? She knew the rope had to be tied securely. That was why she had gotten angry and stomped off ahead and was now in this dangerous predicament... but she should have known better.  "I'm ready, Jondalar," she called, after wrapping it around her and fastening it with many knots. "These knots won't slip." "All right. Now hang on to the rope. We're going to pull you up," he said.  Ayla felt the rope grow taut, then lift her from the ledge. Her feet were dangling in air as she felt herself slowly rising toward the edge of the crevasse. She saw Jondalar's face, and his beautiful, worried blue eyes, and she gripped the hand he held out to her to help her over the rim. Then she was on the surface again, and Jondalar was crushing her in his arms. She clung to him as tightly.  "I thought you were gone for sure," he said, kissing and holding her.  "I'm sorry I yelled at you, Ayla. I know you can load your own packs.  I just worry so much." "No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have been so careless with my eye protectors, and I should never have rushed ahead of you like that. I'm still not familiar with ice." "But I let you, and I should have known better." "I should have known better," Ayla said at the same time. They smiled at each other at the inadvertent matching of words.  Ayla felt a tug at her waist and saw that the other end of the rope was fastened to the brown stallion. Racer had pulled her out of the crevasse. She rumbled to untie the knots around her waist while Jon- dalar held the sturdy horse close by. She finally had to use a knife to cut the rope. She had made so many knots and had pulled them so tight--and they'd grown even tighter as she was lifted out--that they were impossible to untie.    Detouring around the crack that had so nearly proved disastrous they continued their southwesterly course across the ice. They were growing seriously concerned as their supply of burning stones was becoming depleted.  "How much longer before we reach the other side, Jondalar?" Ayla asked in the morning after melting water for them all. "We don't have many burning stones left." "I know. I had hoped that we would be there by now. The storms have caused more delay than I planned on, and I'm getting worried that the weather will turn while we are on the ice. It can happen so fast," Jondalar said, scanning the sky carefully as he spoke. "I'm afraid it may be coming soon." "Why?" "I got to thinking about that silly argument we had before you fell into the crevasse. Remember how everyone was warning us about the evil spirits that ride ahead of the snow-melter?" "Yes!" Ayla said. "Solandia and Verdegia said they make you feel irritable, and I was feeling very irritable. I still do. I am so sick and tired of this ice, I have to force myself to keep going. Could that be what it is?" "That's what I was wondering. Ayla, if it's true, we have to hurry.  If the foehn comes while we're up on this glacier, we may all fall into the cracks," Jondalar said.  They tried to ration the peaty brown stones more carefully, drinking their water barely melted. Ayla and Jondalar started carrying their waterbags full of snow underneath their fur parkas so their body heat would melt enough for them and Wolf. But the conservation wasn't enough. Their bodies couldn't melt enough for the horses that way, and when the last of the burning stones were gone, there was no water for the horses. She had run out of feed for them, too, but water was more important. Ayla noticed them chewing ice, but it worried her.  Both dehydration and eating ice could chill them so that they wouldn't be able to maintain sufficient body heat to keep warm on the freezing cold glacier.  Both horses had come to her looking for water, after they had set up their tent, but all Ayla could do was give them a few sips of her own water and break up some ice for them. There had been no afternoon torm that day, and they had kept going until it was almost too dark to eg. They had traveled a good distance, and should have been glad, »ut she felt strangely uncomfortable. She had trouble getting to sleep bat night. She tried to shrug it off, telling herself she was just worried bout the horses.  i Jondalar lay awake for a long time, too. He thought the horizon was ooking closer, but he was afraid it was wishful thinking and didn't want to mention it. When he finally dozed off, he awoke in the middle |bf the night to find Ayla wide awake, too. They got up at the first faint l|duft from black to blue, and they started out with stars still in the sky.  I, By midmorning the wind had shifted, and Jondalar was sure his Iworst fears were about to materialize. The wind wasn't so much warm ^s less cold, but it was coming from the south.  j "Hurry, Ayla! We've got to hurry," he said, almost breaking into a run. She nodded and kept up with him.  By noon the sky was clear, and the brisk breeze blowing in their faces was so warm that it was almost balmy. The force of the wind increased, enough to slow them down as they leaned into it. And its warmth blowing across the cold surface of the ice was a deadly caress.  The drifts of dry powdery snow became wet and compact, then turned to slush. Little puddles of water began to form in small depressions on the surface. They became deeper and took on a vivid blue color that seemed to glow out of the center of the ice, but the woman and man had no time, or heart, to appreciate the beauty. The horses' need for water was easily satisfied, but it gave them little comfort now.  A soft mist began to rise, clinging close to the surface; the driving, warm south wind carried it away before it could get too high. Jondalar was using a long spear to feel the way ahead, but he was still almost running, and Ayla was hard-pressed to keep up. She wished she could jump on Whinney's back and let the horse carry her away, but more and more cracks were opening in the ice. He was almost certain the horizon was closer, but the low-lying fog made distances deceptive.  Little rivulets began streaming over the surface of the ice, connecting the puddles and making footing treacherous. They splashed through the water, feeling its icy chill penetrate, then squish through their boots. Suddenly, a few feet in front of them, a large section of what had seemed to be solid ice fell away, exposing a yawning gulf. Wolf  yipped and whined, and the horses shied away, squealing with fear Jondalar turned and followed the edge of the crack, looking for a way around.  "Jondalar, I can't keep going. I'm exhausted. I've got to stop," Ayla said with a sob, then started crying. "We'll never make it." He stopped, then went back and comforted her. "We're almost there, Ayla. Look. You can see how close the edge is." "But we almost walked into a crevasse, and some of those puddles have become deep blue holes with streams falling into them." "Do you want to stay here?" he said.  Ayla took a deep breath. "No, of course not," she said. "I don't know why I'm crying like this. If we stay here, we'll die for sure." Jondalar worked his way around the large crack, but as they turned south again, the winds were as strong as any from the north had been, and they could feel the temperature rising. Rivulets turned into streams crisscrossing the ice and grew into rivers. They worked their way around two more large cracks and could see beyond the ice. They ran the last short distance, and then they stood looking down over the edge.  They had reached the other side of the glacier.  A waterfall of milky clouded water, glacier milk, was just below them, gushing out of the bottom of the ice. In the distance, below the snowline, was a thin cover of light green.  "Do you want to stop here and rest a while?" Jondalar asked, but he looked worried.  "I just want to get off this ice. We can rest when we reach that meadow," Ayla said.  "It's farther than it looks. This is not the place to rush or be careless.  We'll rope ourselves together, and I think you should go first. If you slip, I can support your weight. Pick a way down carefully. We can lead the horses." "No, I don't think we should. I think we should take off their halters and packs, and the pole drag, and let them find their own way down," Ayla said.  "Maybe you're right, but then we'll have to leave the packs here.  unless..." Ayla saw where he was looking. "Let's put everything in the bowl boat and let it slide down!" she said.  "Except a small pack with some necessities that we can take with us," he said, smiling.  "If we tie it all down well, and watch which way it goes, we should be able to find it."  "What if it breaks up?" "What would break?" "The frame could crack," Jondalar said, "but even if it did, the hide Jwould probably hold it together." "And whatever was inside would still be all right, wouldn't it?" "It should be." Jondalar smiled. "I think that's a good idea." After the round boat was repacked, Jondalar picked up the small Ipack of essentials while Ay la led Whinney. Although somewhat fearful 'gf slipping, they walked along the edge looking for a way down. As if Ito make up for the delays and dangers they had endured in the cross- !ing, they soon found the gradual slope of a moraine, with all its gravel, Ithat appeared possible, just beyond a somewhat steeper grade of slick I ice. They dragged the boat to the icy slope; then Ayla unfastened the '; travois. They removed all the halters and ropes from both animals, but not the mammoth-hide horse boots. Ayla checked them to make sure they were securely tied; they had conformed to the shape of the horses' ihooves and now fit snugly. Then they led the horses to the top of the moraine.  Whinney nickered, and Ayla calmed her, calling her by the whinny name she was most familiar with, and she spoke in their language of signals and sounds and made-up words. "Whinney, you need to make your own way down," the woman said. "No one else can find your footing on this ice better than you can." Jondalar reassured the young stallion. The descent would be dangerous, anything could happen, but at least they had gotten the horses across. They would have to get themselves down. Wolf was pacing nervously back and forth along the edge of the ice, the way he did when he was afraid to jump into a river.  With Ayla's urgings, Whinney was the first to go over the edge, picking her way carefully. Racer was close on her heels and soon outdistanced her. They came to a slick spot, slipped and slid, gained momentum, and moved down faster to keep up. They would be down safely--or not--by the time Ayla and Jondalar reached the bottom.  Wolf was whining at the top, his tail tucked between his legs, not ashamed to show the fear he felt as he watched the horses go.  "Let's push the boat over and get started. It's a long way down, and it won't be easy," Jondalar said.  As they pushed the boat near the steeper icy edge, Wolf suddenly Jumped in it. "He must think we're getting ready to ride across a river," Ayla said. "I wish we could float down this ice." They both looked at each other and started to smile.  "What do you think?" Jondalar said.  "Why not? You said it should hold together." "But will we?" "Let's find out!" They shifted a few things around to make room, then climbed into the bowl-shaped boat with Wolf. Jondalar sent a hopeful thought to the Mother, and, using one of the travois poles, they pushed off.  "Hold on!" Jondalar said as they started over the edge.  They gained speed quickly, but headed straight ahead at first. Then they hit a bump and the boat bounced and spun around. They swerved sideward, then rode up a slight incline and found themselves in midair.  They both screamed with the fearful excitement. They landed with a jolt that lifted them all up, the wolf included, then spun around again while they clutched the edge. The wolf was trying to crouch down and poke his nose over the side at the same time.  Ayla and Jondalar held on for all they were worth; it was all they could do. They had absolutely no control over the round boat that was racing down the side of the glacier. It zigged and zagged, bounced and spun around as though leaping with joy, but it was heavily loaded, bottom heavy enough to resist tipping over. Though the man and woman screamed involuntarily, they couldn't help smiling. It was the fastest, most thrilling ride either of them had ever taken, but it was not over.  They didn't think about how the ride would end, and, as they neared the bottom, Jondalar remembered the usual crevasse at the foot separating the ice from the ground below. A hard landing on gravel could throw them out and cause injury, or worse, but the sound didn't make an impression on him when he first heard it. It wasn't until they landed with a hard bump and a huge splash into the middle of a roaring waterfall of cloudy water that he realized their descent down the wet slippery ice had taken them back toward the river of meltwater that was gushing out of the bottom of the glacier.  They landed at the bottom of the falls with another splash, and soon they were floating calmly in the middle of a small lake of cloudy green glacier melt. Wolf was so happy that he was all over both of them, licking their faces. He finally sat down and lifted his head in a howl of greeting.  Jondalar looked at the woman, "Ayla, we made it! We made it!  We're over the glacier!" "We did, didn't we?" she said, smiling broadly.  "That was a dangerous thing to do, though," he said. "We could have been hurt, or even killed."  "It may have been dangerous, but it was fun," Ayla said, her eyes still sparkling with excitement.  Her enthusiasm was contagious, and for all his concern about getting her home safely, he had to smile. "You're right. It was fun, and fitting, Isomehow. I don't think I'll ever try to cross a glacier again. Twice in ione lifetime is enough, but I'm glad I can say I did it, and I'll never forget that ride." "Now, all we have to do is reach that land over there," Ayla said, pointing toward the shore, "and then find Whinney and Racer." The sun was setting, and, between the blinding brightness at the I horizon and twilight's deceptive shadows, it was difficult to see. The | evening chill had brought the temperature to below freezing again.  | They could see the comforting security of the black loam of solid t ground, intermixed with patches of snow, around the perimeter of the I lake, but they didn't know how to get there. They had no paddle, and ( they had left the pole on top of the glacier.  | But although the lake seemed calm, the fast-flowing glacial melt gave it an undercurrent that was slowly taking them toward the shore.  When they were close, they both jumped out of the boat, followed by the wolf, and pulled it up on the land. Wolf shook himself, spraying water, but neither Ayla norjondalar noticed. They were in each other's arms, expressing their love and their relief at having actually reached solid ground.  "We did make it. We're almost home, Ayla. We're almost home," Jondalar said, holding her, grateful that she was there to be held.  The snow around the lake was beginning to refreeze, turning soft slush into hard-crusted ice. They walked across the gravel in the near dark holding hands, until they reached a field. There was no wood for a fire, but they didn't care. They ate the dry concentrated traveling food that had been their sustenance on the ice, and they drank water from bags filled on the glacier. Then they set up their tent and spread out their sleeping furs, but before they settled in, Ayla looked across the darkened landscape and wondered where the horses were.  She whistled for Whinney and waited to hear the sound of hooves, but no horses came. She looked up at the swirling clouds above and wondered where they were, then whistled again. It was too dark to look for them now; it would have to wait until morning. Ayla crawled into her sleeping furs beside the tall man and reached for the wolf who was curled up beside her place. She thought about the horses as she sank into an exhausted sleep.  The man looked at the tousled blond hair of the woman beside him her head resting comfortably in the hollow beneath his shoulder, and he changed his mind about getting up. There was no longer a need to keep moving, but the absence of worry left him at loose ends. He had to keep reminding himself they were over the glacier; they didn't have to hurry any more. They could lie around in their sleeping furs all day if they wanted to.  The glacier was behind them now, and Ayla was safe. He shivered at the thought of her close call, and he tightened his hold on her. The woman raised herself up on her elbow and looked at him. She loved looking at him. The dim light inside the hide tent softened the vivid blue of his eyes, and his forehead, so often knotted in concentration or concern, was relaxed now. She ran a finger lightly across the worry lines, then traced his features.  "Do you know, before I saw you I tried to imagine how a man would look. Not a man of the Clan, one like me. I never could. You are beautiful, Jondalar," she said.  Jondalar laughed. "Ayla, women are beautiful. Not men." "What is a man then?" "You might say he's strong, or brave." "You are strong and brave, but that's not the same as beautiful. What would you call a man who is beautiful?" "Handsome, I suppose." He felt a little embarrassed. He had been called handsome too often.  "Handsome. Handsome," she repeated to herself. "I like beautiful better. Beautiful I understand." Jondalar laughed again, his rich, surprisingly lusty laugh. The uninhibited warmth of it was unexpected, and Ayla caught herself staring at him. He had been so serious on this trip. Though he had smiled, he'd seldom laughed out loud.  "If you want to call me beautiful, go ahead," he said, pulling her closer to him. "How can I object to a beautiful woman calling me beautiful?" Ayla felt the spasms of his laughter, and she started giggling. "I love it when you laugh, Jondalar." "And, I love you, funny woman." He held her after they stopped laughing. Feeling her warmth and soft full breasts, he reached for one and pulled her down so he could kiss her. She slipped her tongue into his mouth and felt herself respond with a surprising hunger for him. It had been some time, she realized.  All the time they were on the glacier, they both had been so anxious and so exhausted that they hadn't been in the mood, or able to relax enough to get there.  He sensed her eager willingness and felt his own sudden need. He rolled her over as they kissed; then, moving the furs out of the way, he kissed her throat and neck on the way to finding her breast. He enclosed her hard nipple with his mouth and suckled.  She moaned as a sharp shiver of unbelievable Pleasure charged through her with an intensity that left her gasping. She was stunned by her own reaction. He had barely touched her, and she was ready, and she felt so eager. It hadn't been that long, had it? She pushed herself toward him.  Jondalar reached down to touch her place of Pleasures between her thighs, felt her hard knob and massaged it. With a few cries, she reached a sudden peak, and was there, ready for him, wanting him.  He felt her sudden moist warmth, and understood her readiness.  His need had risen to match hers. Pushing at the furs to get them out of the way, she opened to him. He reached for her deep well with his proud manhood and entered.  She pulled him to her as he thrust forward, penetrating deeply.  He felt her full embrace, and she cried out with her joy. She had needed him, and he felt so right, it was beyond delight, more than Pleasure.  He was as ready as she. He pulled back, then thrust again, and only once more, and suddenly, there was no holding back. He felt the surge rise, reach, and overflow. With a last few motions, he drained himself, then pushed in, and relaxed on top of her.  She lay still with her eyes closed, feeling his weight on her, and feeling wonderful. She didn't want to move. When he finally got up and looked down at her, he had to kiss her. She opened her eyes and looked up at him.  "That was wonderful, Jondalar," she said, feeling languid and satisfied.  "It was fast. You were ready; we were both ready. And you had the strangest smile on your face just now." "That's because I'm so happy." "I am, too," he said, kissing her again, then rolling onto his side.  They lay together quietly and dozed off again. Jondalar woke before Ayla did, and he watched her while she slept. The strange little smile appeared again and made him wonder what she was dreaming of. He couldn't resist. He kissed her softly and caressed her breast. She opened her eyes. They were dilated, dark and liquid, and full of deep secrets.  He kissed each eyelid, then nibbled playfully at an earlobe and then a nipple. She smiled at him when he reached for her mound and felt  her soft hair, receptive, if not quite ready again, making him wish they were just beginning instead of just through. Suddenly he held her tight, kissed her fiercely, stroked her body, her breasts and hips and thighs. He could hardly keep his hands away from her, as though coming so close to losing her had created a need as deep as the crevasse that almost took her. He couldn't touch her enough, hold her enough love her enough.  "I never thought I'd fall in love," he said, relaxing again and idly caressing the dip at the small of her back and the smooth mound beyond. "Why did I have to travel beyond the end of the Great Mother River to find a woman I could love?" He had been thinking about that ever since he woke up and realized they were almost home. It was good to be on this side of the glacier, but he was full of anticipation, wondering about everyone, and eager to see them.  "Because my totem meant you for me. The Cave Lion guided you." "Then why did the Mother cause us to be born so far apart?" Ayla lifted her head and looked at him. "I've been learning, but I still know very little about the ways of the Great Earth Mother, and not much more about the protective spirits of the Clan totems, but I know this: you found me." "And then I almost lost you." A sudden rush of cold fear clutched at him. "Ayla, what would I do if I lost you?" he said, his voice hoarse with the emotion he seldom showed openly. He rolled over, covering her body with his, and buried his head in her neck, holding her so tightly she could hardly breathe. "What would I do?" She clung to him, wishing there was some way she could become a part of him, and she gratefully opened herself to him when she felt his need swell again. With an urgency as demanding as his love, he took her as she came to him with a need as driving.  It was over even more quickly, and with the release, the tension of their fierce emotion melted into a warm afterglow. When he started to move aside, she held him, wanting to cling to the intensity of the moment.  "I wouldn't want to live without you, Jondalar," Ayla said, picking up the conversation begun before their lovemaking. "A piece of me would go with you to the spirit world, I'd never be whole again. But we're lucky. Think of all the people who never find love, and those who love someone who cannot love them back." "Like Ranee?" "Yes, like Ranee. I still hurt inside when I think of him."  Jondalar rolled over and sat up. "I feel sorry for him. I liked Ranee --or I could have." Suddenly he was eager to be moving. "We'll never get to Dalanar's this way," he said, starting to roll up sleeping furs. "I can't wait to see him again." "But first, we have to find the horses," Ayla said.    A >.yla got up and went outside the tent. A mist hovered close to the ground and the air felt cold and damp on her bare skin. She could hear the roar of the waterfall in the distance, but the vapor thickened into a dense fog near the back end of the lake, a long narrow body of greenish water, so cloudy it was nearly opaque.  No fish lived in such a place, she was sure, just as no vegetation grew along the edge; it was too new for life, too raw. There was only water and stone, and a quality of time before time, of ancient beginnings before life began. Ayla shivered and felt a stark taste of Her terrible loneliness before the Great Mother Earth gave birth to all living things.  She stopped to pass her water, then hurried across the sharp-edged gravel shore, waded in, then ducked down. It was icy cold and gritty with silt. She wanted to bathe--it hadn't been possible while they were crossing the ice--but not in this water. She didn't mind the cold so much, but she wanted clear, fresh water.  She started back to the tent to dress and help Jondalar pack up. On the way, she looked through the mist across the lifeless landscape to a hint of trees below. Suddenly she smiled.  "There you are!" she said, sounding a loud whistle.  Jondalar was out of the tent in an instant. He smiled as broadly as Ayla to see the two horses galloping toward them. Wolf followed along behind, and Ayla thought he looked pleased with himself. He hadn't been around that morning, and she wondered if he had played any part in the horses' return. She shook her head, realizing she would probably never know.  They greeted each horse with hugs, caressing strokes, friendly scratches, and words of affection. Ayla checked them over carefully at the same time, wanting to be sure they had not injured themselves.  The horse boot on Whinney's right rear foot was missing and the mare seemed to flinch when Ayla examined her leg. Could she have broken through the ice at the edge of the glacier and, in pulling free, torn on the boot and bruised her leg? It was the only thing she could think of.  ; Ay la removed the rest of the mare's boots, lifting each leg to untie S them while Jondalar stood close to steady the animal. Racer still had I? all h^ horse boots, although Jondalar noticed they were wearing thin I over the sharp hooves; even mammoth hide would not last long worn I over hooves.  | When they had gathered all their things together and gone to drag I the bowl boat closer, they discovered the bottom was wet and soggy.  I It had developed a leak.  |1 "I don't think I'd want to try getting across a river in this, any more," | Jondalar said. "Do you think we should leave it?" | "We have to, unless we want to drag it ourselves. We don't have the I poles for the travois. We left them behind when we came flying down ? that ice, and there are no trees around here for new ones," Ayla said.  | "Well, that settles it!" Jondalar said. "It's a good thing we don't need | to haul rocks any more, and we've lightened our load so much that I ; think we could carry everything ourselves, even without the horses." i "If they hadn't come back, that's what we'd be doing while we were looking for them," Ayla said, "but I am so glad they found us." "I was worried about them, too," Jondalar said.  '!    ; As they descended the steep southwestern face of the ancient massif that supported the harrowing ice field on its worn summit, a light rain ^ fell, flushing out pockets of dirty snow that filled shaded hollows in the open spruce forest they passed through. But a watercolor wash of green tinged the brown earth of a sloping meadow and brushed the tips of shrubs nearby. Below, through openings in the misty fog, they caught glimpses of a river curling from west to north, forced by the surrounding highlands to follow a deep rift valley. Across the river to the south, the rugged alpine foreland faded into a purple haze, but rising wraith- like out of the haze was the high mountain range with ice halfway down its slopes.  "You're going to like Dalanar," Jondalar was saying as they rode comfortably side by side. "You'll like all the Lanzadonii. Most of them used to be Zeiandonii, like me." "What made him decide to start a new Cave?" "I'm not sure. I was so young when he and my mother parted, I didn't really get to know him until I went to live with him, and he taught Joplaya and me how to work the stone. I don't think he decided to settle and start a new Cave until he met Jerika, but he chose this place because he found the flint mine. People were already talking about Lanzadonii stone when I was a boy," Jondalar explained.  "Jerika is his mate, and... Joplaya... is your cousin, right?"  "Yes. Close-cousin. Jerika's daughter, born to Dalanar's hearth She's a good flint knapper, too, but don't ever tell her I said so. She's a great tease, always joking. I wonder if she's found a mate. Great Mother! It's been so long. They are going to be so surprised to see us!" "Jondalar!" Ayla said in a loud, urgent whisper. He pulled up short.  "Look over there, near those trees. There's a deer!" The man smiled. "Let's get it!" he said, reaching for a spear as he pulled out his spear-thrower and signaled Racer with his knees. Although his method of guiding his mount was not quite the same as hers, after nearly a year of traveling, he was as good a rider as Ayla.  She turned Whinney almost in tandem--she enjoyed being free and unencumbered by the travois for a change--and set her spear in her spear-thrower. Startled by the quick movement, the deer bounded off with high leaps, but they raced after it, coming up on either side and, with the help of the spear-throwers, dispatched the young, inexperienced buck easily. They butchered out their favorite parts and selected other choice cuts to bring as a gift to Dalanar's people, then let Wolf have his pick of what was left.  Toward evening, they found a racing, bubbling, healthy-looking stream and followed it until they came to a large open field with a few trees and some brush beside the water. They decided to make camp early and cook some of their deer meat. The rain had let up and there wasn't any hurry any more, though they had to keep reminding themselves of that.  The following morning, when Ayla stepped out of the tent, she stopped and gaped in amazement, stunned by the sight. The landscape seemed unreal, with the quality of an especially vivid dream. It seemed impossible that they could have endured the most harshly bitter intensity of extreme winter conditions only days ago and, suddenly, it was spring!  "Jondalar! Oh, Jondalar. Come and see!" The man put his sleepy head out of the opening, and she watched his smile grow.  They were at a lower elevation, and the rainy drizzle and fog of the day before had given way to a bright new sun. The sky was a rich azure blue decorated with mounds of white. Trees and brush were flocked with the fresh bright green of new leaves and the grass in the field looked good enough to eat. Flowers--jonquils, lilies, columbines, irises, and more--bloomed in profusion. Birds of every color and many varieties darted and wheeled through the air, chirping and singing.  Ayla recognized most of them--thrushes, nightingales, bluethroats, nutcrackers, black-headed woodpeckers, and river warblers--and  whistled their song back to them. Jondalar got up and came out of the tent in time to watch with admiration while she patiently coaxed a gray shrike to her hand.  "I don't know how you do that," he said, as the bird flew away.  Ayla smiled. "I'm going to look for something fresh and delicious to eat this morning," she said.  Wolf was gone again, and Ayla was sure he was exploring or hunting; spring brought adventures for him, too. She headed toward the horses, who were in the middle of the spring meadow grazing on the fine short blades of sweet grass. It was the rich season, the time of growth throughout the land.  For most of the year the broad plains surrounding the miles-thick sheets of ice, and the high mountain meadows, were dry and cold.  Only scant rain or snow managed to fall on the land; the glaciers usually captured most of the moisture circulating in the air for themselves.  Though permafrost was as pervasive on the ancient steppes as in the wetter northern tundras of later times, the glacier-driven winds kept the summers arid, and the land dry and firm, with few bogs. In winter, the winds kept the light snows blown into drifts, leaving large sections of the frozen ground bare of snow, but covered with grass that had dried into hay; feed that maintained the uncountable numbers of huge grazing animals.  But not all grasslands are the same. To create the rich abundance of the Ice Age plains, it wasn't so much the amount of precipitation--so long as it was sufficient--as when it fell; a combination of moisture and drying winds in the right proportions and at the right times made the difference.  Because of the angle of incoming sunlight, in lower latitudes the sun begins to warm the earth not long after the winter solstice. Where snow or ice have accumulated, most of the early spring sunlight is reflected back into space, and the little that is absorbed and converted to heat must be used to melt the snow cover before plants can grow.  But on the ancient grasslands, where winds had laid the plains bare, the sun poured its energy onto the dark soil, and received a warm welcome. The dry, frozen top layers of permafrost began to warm and thaw, and though it was still cold, the wealth of solar energy impelled seeds and extensive roots to prepare to send up shoots. But water in usable form was necessary if they were to flourish.  The glistening ice resisted the warming rays of spring, reflecting back the sunlight. But with so much moisture stored in the mountain- high icy sheets, it could not entirely reject the sun's advances or its caress of warming winds. The tops of the glaciers began to melt, and  some water trickled down through the fissures and slowly began to fill streams, and then rivers, which would bring the precious liquid to the parched land later in summer. But even more important were the fogs and the mists evaporating off the glacial masses of frozen water, because they filled the skies with rain clouds.  In spring, the warm sunlight caused the great mass of ice to give off moisture rather than to take it. For almost the only time during the entire year, rain fell, not on the glacier, but on the thirsty and fertile land that bounded it. An Ice Age summer could be hot, but it was brief; the primeval spring was long and wet, and plant growth was explosive and profuse.  Ice Age animals also did their growing in spring when everything was fresh and green, and rich in the nutrients they needed, at just the time they needed them. By nature, whether the season is lush or dry, spring is the time of the year when animals add size to young bones or to old tusks and horns, or grow new and bigger antlers, or shed thick winter coats and begin new ones. Because spring started early and lasted long, the growing season for animals was long as well, which encouraged their lavish size, and the impressive horny adornments.  During the long spring, all the species partook of the herbaceous green bounty indiscriminately, but with the end of the growing season they faced fierce competition from each other for the maturing and less nutritious or less digestible grasses and herbs. The competition did not express itself in squabbling over who would eat first or most, or in guarding boundaries. Herding animals of the plains were not territorial.  They migrated over great distances and were highly social, seeking the company of their own kind as they traveled, and sharing their ranges with others that were adapted to open grasslands.  But whenever more than one species of animal had nearly identical eating and living habits, invariably only one would prevail. The others would evolve new ways to exploit another niche, utilize some other element of the available food, migrate to a new area, or die off. None of the many different grazing and browsing animals were in direct competition with each other for exactly the same food.  Fighting was always between males of the same kind, and was saved for rutting season, when often the mere display of a particularly imposing rack of antlers or pair of horns or tusks was enough to establish dominance and the right to breed--genetically compelling reasons for the magnificent embellishments that the rich spring growth encouraged.  But once the surfeit of spring was over, life for the itinerant dwellers of the steppes settled into established patterns, and it was never as  easy. In summer they had to maintain the spectacular growth spring had wrought and fill out and put on fat for the harsh season ahead.  Autumn brought the demanding rutting season for some; for others the growth of heavy fur and other protective measures. But hardest of all was winter; in winter they had to survive.  Winter determined the carrying capacity of the land; winter decided who would live and who would die. Winter was hard on males, with a larger body size and heavy social adornments to maintain or regrow.  Winter was hard on females, who were smaller in size because they had not only to sustain themselves with essentially the same amount of available food, but also the next generation either developing inside them, or nursing, or both. But winter was particularly hard on the young, who lacked the size of adults to store reserves, and spent what they had accumulated on growth. If they could survive their first year, their chances were much better.  On the dry, cold, ancient grasslands near the glaciers, the great diversity of animals shared the complex and productive land and were maintained because eating and living habits of one species fit in between or around those of another. Even the carnivores had preferred prey. But an inventive, creative new species, one that didn't so much adapt to the environment as alter the environment to suit itself, was beginning to make its presence felt.    Ayla was strangely quiet when they stopped for a rest near another gurgling mountain stream, to finish the venison and fresh greens they had cooked that morning.  "It's not very far now. Thonolan and I stopped near here when we left," Jondalar said.  "It's breathtaking," she answered, but only part of her mind appreciated the breathtaking view.  "Why so quiet, Ayla?" "I've been thinking about your kin. It makes me realize, I don't have any kin." "You have kin! What about the Mamutoi? Aren't you Ayla of the Mamutoi?" "It's not the same. I miss them, and I'll always love them, but.it wasn't so hard to leave. It was harder the other time, when I had to leave Durc behind." A look of pain filled her eyes.  "Ayla, I know it must have been difficult to leave a son." He took her in his arms. "It wouldn't bring him back, but the Mother may give you other children... someday... perhaps even children of my spirit."  She didn't seem to hear him. "They said Durc was deformed, but he wasn't. He was Clan, but he was mine, too. He was part of both.  They didn't think I was deformed, just ugly, and I was taller than any man of the Clan... big and ugly..." "Ayla, you are not big and ugly. You are beautiful, and remember, my kin are your kin." She looked up at him. "Until you came, I had no one, Jondalar.  Now I have you to love and maybe, someday, a child of yours. That would make me happy," she said, smiling.  Her smile relieved him, and her mention of a child even more. He looked up at the sun's position in the sky. "We won't make it to Dal- anar's cave today if we don't hurry. Come on, Ayla, the horses need a good run. I'll race you across the meadow. I don't think I could stand another night in the tent when we're so close." Wolf bounded out of the woods, full of energy and playfulness. He jumped up, put his paws on her chest, and licked her jaw. This was her family, she thought, as she grabbed his neck fur. This magnificent wolf, the faithful and patient mare, the spirited stallion, and the man, the wonderful caring man. Soon she would be meeting his family.  She fell silent while she packed the few things; then suddenly she started digging things out of a different pack. "Jondalar, I'm going to take a bath in this stream and put on a clean tunic and leggings," she said, taking off the leather tunic she had been wearing.  "Why don't you wait until we get there. You'll freeze, Ayla. That water is probably straight off the glacier." "I don't care, I don't want to meet your kin all dirty and travel stained." They came to a river, cloudy green with glacial runoff, and running high, though the rushing water would be much higher when it reached its full volume later in the season. They turned east, upstream, until they found a place shallow enough to ford, then climbed in a southeasterly direction. It was late afternoon when they reached a gradual slope that leveled out near a rock wall. The dark hole of a cave was tucked under an overhanging ledge.  A young woman was seated on the ground, her back to them, surrounded by broken chips and nodules of flint. She held a punch, a pointed wooden stick, to a core of the dark gray stone with one hand, concentrating on the exact placement, and preparing to hit the punch with a heavy bone hammer held in the other. She was so absorbed in her task that she didn't notice Jondalar slipping up silently behind her.  "Keep practicing, Joplaya. Someday you'll be as good as I am," he said with a grin.  The bone mallet came down wrong, shattering the blade she was about to flake off as she whirled around, a look of stunned disbelief on her face.  "Jondalar! Oh, Jondalar! Is it really you?" she cried, throwing herself into his arms. With his arms around her waist, he picked her up and spun her around. She clung to him, as though she never wanted to let him go. "Mother! Dalanar! Jondalar's back! Jondalar came back!" she shouted.  People came running out of the cave, and an older man, as tall as Jondalar, raced toward him. They grabbed each other, stood back and looked, then hugged again.  Ayla signaled Wolf, who crowded close to her as she stood back and watched, holding the lead ropes of both horses.  "So, you came back! You were gone so long, I didn't think you would," the man said.  Then, over Jondalar's shoulder, the older man spied a most astounding sight. Two horses, with baskets and bundles fastened to them, and hides draped across their backs, and a large wolf, were hovering close to a tall woman, dressed in a fur parka and leggings cut in an unusual style and decorated with unfamiliar patterns. Her hood was thrown back, and the woman's deep golden hair cascaded around her face in waves. There was a decidedly foreign cast to her features, rather like the unfamiliar cut of her clothing, but it only added to her outstanding beauty.  "I don't see your brother, but you did not return alone," the man said.  "Thonolan is dead," Jondalar said, closing his eyes involuntarily. "I would be, too, if it wasn't for Ayla." "I'm sorry to hear that. I liked the boy. Willomar and your mother will be grief-stricken. But I notice your taste in women has not changed. You always did have a liking for beautiful zeiandonia." Jondalar wondered why he thought Ayla was One Who Served the Mother. Then he looked at her, surrounded by the animals, and suddenly saw her as the older man would, and he smiled. He strode to the edge of the clearing, took Racer's lead, and started walking back, followed by Ayla, Whinney, and Wolf.  "Dalanar of the Lanzadonii, please welcome Ayla of the Mamutoi," he said.  Dalanar held out both hands, palms up, in the greeting of openness and friendship. Ayla grasped them with both of hers.  "In the name of Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi," Dalanar said.  "I greet you, Dalanar of the Lanzadonii," Ayla replied, with the proper formality.  "You speak our language well for someone from so far away. It is my pleasure to meet you." His formality was belied by his smile. He had noticed her manner of speaking and thought it most intriguing.  "Jondalar taught me to speak," she said, hardly able to keep from staring. She glanced at Jondalar, then back at Dalanar, stunned by their resemblance.  Dalanar's long blond hair was a little thinner on top and his waist a little thicker, but he had the same intensely blue eyes—a few creases at the comers—and the same high forehead, his worry lines etched a little deeper. His voice had the same quality, too, the same pitch, the same tone. He even stressed the word pleasure the same way, giving it the hint of a double meaning. It was uncanny. The warmth of his hands started a tingling response in her. His similarity even confused her body for a moment.  Dalanar felt her response and smiled Jondalar's smile, understanding the reason and liking her for it. With that strange accent, he thought, she must come from someplace quite far away. When he dropped her hands, the wolf suddenly approached him, quite fearlessly, although he couldn't say he felt the same way himself. Wolf insinuated his head under Dalanar's hand, looking for attention, as though he knew the man. To his own surprise, Dalanar found himself stroking the hand some animal, as though it were perfectly natural to pet a large living wolf.  Jondalar was grinning. "Wolf thinks you're me. Everyone always said we looked alike. Next you'll be on Racer's back." He held the lead rope toward the man.  "Did you say 'Racer's back'?" Dalanar said.  "Yes. Most of the way here, we rode on the backs of those horses; Racer is the name I gave the stallion," Jondalar explained. "Ayla's horse is Whinney, and this big beast that's taken such a liking to you is called 'Wolf.' That's the Mamutoi word for a wolf." "How did you ever get a wolf, and horses..." Dalanar began.  "Dalanar, where are your manners? Don't you think other people want to meet her and hear their stories?" Ayla, still slightly flustered by Dalanar's amazing resemblance to Jondalar, turned to the one who spoke—and found herself staring again. The woman resembled no one Ayla had ever seen before. Her hair, pulled back from her face into a roll at the back of her head, was glossy black, streaked with gray at the temples. But it was her face that held Ay la's attention. It was round and flat with high cheekbones, a tiny nose, and dark slanting eyes. The woman's smile contradicted her stem voice and Dalanar beamed as he looked down at her.  "Jerika!" Jondalar said, smiling with delight.  "Jondalar! It's so good to have you back!" They hugged with obvious affection. "Since this great bear of a man of mine has no manners, why don't you introduce me to your companion? And then you can tell me why those animals stand there and don't run away," the woman said.  She moved between the two men and was dwarfed by them. They were exactly the same height, and the top of her head barely reached midway up their chests. Her walk was quick and energetic. She reminded Ay la of a bird, an impression reinforced by her diminutive size.  "Jerika of the Lanzadonii, please greet Ayla of the Mamutoi. She is the one responsible for the behavior of the animals," Jondalar said, beaming at the small woman with Dalanar's expression. "She can tell you better than I why they don't run away." "You are welcome here, Ayla of the Mamutoi," Jerika said, with hands outstretched. "And the animals as well, if you can promise they will continue such uncommon ways." She was eying Wolf as she spoke.  "I greet you, Jerika of the Lanzadonii." Ayla returned her smile.  The small woman's grip had a strength that was surprising and, Ayla sensed, a character to match. "The wolf will not harm anyone, unless someone threatens one of us. He is friendly, but very protective. The horses are nervous around strangers and may rear if they are crowded, which could be dangerous. It would be better if people would stay away from them in the beginning, until they get to know everyone better." "That's sensible, but I am glad you told us," she replied, then looked at Ayla with disconcerting directness. "You have come a long way.  The Mamutoi live beyond the end of Donau." "Do you know the land of the Mammoth Hunters?" Ayla asked, surprised.  "Yes, and even farther east, though I don't remember as much of that. Hochaman will be glad to tell you about it. Nothing would please him more than a new ear to listen to his stories. My mother and he came from a land near the Endless Sea, as far east as the land goes. I was born on the way. We lived with many people, sometimes for several years. I remember the Mamutoi. Good people. Fine hunters.  They wanted us to stay with them," Jerika related.  "Why didn't you?"  "Hochaman wasn't ready to settle down. His dream was to travel to the ends of the world, to see how far the land would go. We met Dalanar not long after my mother died and decided to stay and help him get the flint mine started. But Hochaman has lived to see his dream," Jerika said, glancing at her tall mate. "He has traveled all the way from the Endless Sea of the east to the Great Waters of the west.  Dalanar helped him finish his Journey, some years ago, carried him on his back most of the way. Hochaman shed tears when he saw the great western sea, and he washed them away with salt water. He can't walk much now, but no one has made so long a Journey as Hochaman." "Or you, Jerika," Dalanar added proudly. "You've traveled nearly as far." "Hmmmf." She shrugged. "It's not as though I made the choice. But here I scold Dalanar, and then I talk too much." Jondalar had his arm around the waist of the woman he had surprised.  "I'd like to meet your traveling companion," she said.  "I'm sorry, of course," Jondalar said. "Ayla of the Mamutoi, this is my cousin, Joplaya of the Lanzadonii." "I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi," she said, holding out her hands.  "I greet you, Joplaya of the Lanzadonii," Ayla said, suddenly conscious of her accent and glad she had a clean tunic under her parka.  Joplaya was as tall as she, perhaps a shade taller. She had her mother's high cheekbones, but her face was not as flat and her nose was like Jondalar's, only more delicate and finely chisled. Smooth dark eyebrows matched long black hair, and thick black lashes framed eyes with a hint of her mother's slant, but a dazzling green!  Joplaya was a stunningly beautiful woman.  "I am pleased to greet you," Ayla said. "Jondalar has spoken of you so often." "I'm pleased he didn't forget me, altogether," Joplaya replied. She stepped back and Jondalar's arm found her waist again.  Others had crowded around, and Ayla went through a formal greeting with each member of the Cave. They were all curious about the woman Jondalar had brought back, but their scrutiny and questions made her uncomfortable, and she was glad when Jerika intervened.  "I think we should save some questions for later. I'm sure they both have many stories to tell, but they must be tired. Come, Ayla, I will show you where you can stay. Do the animals require anything special?" "I just need to remove their loads and find a place for them to graze.  Wolf will stay inside with us, if you don't object," Ayla said.  She saw that Jondalar was deep in conversation with Joplaya, and she unloaded the packs from both horses herself, but he hurried over to help her take their things into the cave.  "I think I know just the place for the horses," he said. "I'll take them there. Do you want to keep the lead on Whinney? I'm going to tie Racer down with a long rope." "No, I don't think so. She'll stay near Racer." Ayla noticed that he was feeling so entirely comfortable, he didn't even have to ask. But why not? These people were his kin. "I'll go with you, though. To settle her in." They walked to a small grassy dell with a creek running through it that was off around the side. Wolf came with them. After he tied Racer's lead securely, Jondalar started back. "Are you coming?" he asked.  "I'll stay with Whinney a little longer," she said.  "Why don't I go carry our things in, then?" "Yes, go ahead." He seemed eager to get back, not that she blamed him. She signaled the wolf to stay with her. Everything was new to him, too. They all needed some time to settle in, except for Jondalar.  When she returned she looked for him and found him deep in conversation with Joplaya. She hesitated to interrupt.  "Ayla," he said, when he noticed her. "I was telling Joplaya about Wymez. Later, will you show her the spear point he gave you?" She nodded. Jondalar turned back to Joplaya. "Wait until you see it.  The Mamutoi are excellent mammoth hunters, they tip their spears with flint instead of bone. It pierces thick hides better, especially if the blades are thin. Wymez developed a new technique. The point is bifacially knapped, but not like a crude axehead. He heats the stone-- that makes the difference. Finer, thinner flakes sheer off. He can make a point that is longer than my hand with a cross-section so thin and an edge so sharp, you won't believe it." They were standing so close together their bodies were touching as Jondalar excitedly explained the details of the new technique, and their casual intimacy made Ayla uneasy. They had lived together during their adolescent years. What secrets had he told her? What joys and sorrows had they known together? What frustrations and triumphs had they shared as they both learned the difficult art of knapping flint?  How much better did Joplaya know him than she did?  Before, they had both been strangers to the people they met on their Journey. Now, only she was a stranger.  He turned back to Ayla. "Why don't I go and get that point? What basket was it in?" he asked, already on his way.  She told him and smiled nervously at the dark-haired woman after he left, but neither of them spoke. Jondalar was back almost instantly.  "Joplaya, I told Dalanar to come--I've been wanting to show him this point. Wait until you see it." He carefully opened the wrapped package and uncovered a beautifully made flint point just as Dalanar came up. At the sight of the fine spear point, Dalanar took it from Jondalar and examined it closely.  "It's a masterwork! I have never seen such fine craftsmanship," Dalanar exclaimed. "Look at this, Joplaya. It's bifacially worked, but very thin, small flakes are removed. Think of the control, the concentration it must have taken. The feel of this flint is different, and the sheen. It seems almost... oily. Where did you get this? Do they have a different kind of flint in the east?" "No, it's a new process, developed by a Mamutoi man named Wymez. He's the only knapper I've ever met who compares with you, Dalanar. He heats the stone. That's what gives it the sheen, and the feel, but even better, after it's heated, you can remove those fine flakes," Jondalar was explaining with great animation.  Ay la found herself watching him.  "They almost chip off by themselves--that's what gives you the control. I'll show you how he does it. I'm not as good as he is--I need to work on perfecting my technique--but you'll see what I mean. I want to get some good flint while we're here. With the horses, we can carry more weight, and I'd like to bring some Lanzadonii stone home with me." "This is your home, too, Jondalar," Dalanar said quietly. "But, yes, we can go to the mine tomorrow and quarry some fresh stone. I'd like to see how this is done, but is this really a spear point? It looks so thin, and graceful, it almost seems too fragile to hunt with." "They use these spear points for hunting mammoth. It does break more easily, but the sharp flint pierces the thick hide better than a bone point and will slide in between ribs," Jondalar said. "I have something else to show you, too. I developed it when I was recovering from the cave lion mauling, in Ayla's valley. It's a spear-thrower. With it, a spear will fly twice as far. Wait until you see how it works!" "I think they want us to come and eat, Jondalar," Dalanar said, noticing people at the mouth of the cave, beckoning. "Everyone will want to hear your stories. Come inside where you can be comfortable and all can hear. You tease us with these animals that obey your wishes, and comments about cave lion maulings, spear-throwers, new stone-knapping techniques. What other adventures and marvels do you have to share?"  Jondalar laughed. "We haven't even begun. Would you believe we have seen stones that make fire and stones that bum? Dwellings made out of the bones of mammoths, ivory points that pull thread, and huge rivercraft used to hunt fish so big, it would take five men your size, one on top of the other, to reach tip to tail." Ayla had never seen Jondalar so happy and relaxed, so free and unrestrained, and she realized how glad he was to be with his people.  He put an arm around both Ayla and Joplaya as they walked toward the cave. "Have you chosen a mate yet, Joplaya?" Jondalar asked. "I didn't see anyone who seemed to have a claim on you." Joplaya laughed. "No, I've been waiting for you, Jondalar." "There you go, making a joke again," Jondalar said, chuckling. He turned to explain to Ayla. "Close-cousins can't mate, you know." "I have it all planned," Joplaya continued, "I thought we'd run off together and start our own Cave, like Dalanar did. But, of course, we'd only allow flint knappers." Her laugh seemed forced, and she looked only at Jondalar.  "See what I mean, Ayla?" Jondalar said, turning to her but giving Joplaya a squeeze. "Always joking. Joplaya is the worst tease." Ayla wasn't sure she understood the joke.  "Seriously, Joplaya, you must be promised anyway." "Echozar has asked, but I haven't decided yet." "Echozar? I don't think I know him. Is he Zeiandonii?" "He's Lanzadonii. He joined us a few years ago. Dalanar saved his life, found him almost drowned. I think he's still in the cave. He's shy; you'll understand why when you meet him. He looks... well, different.  He doesn't like meeting strangers, he says he doesn't want to come with us to the Zeiandonii Summer Meeting. But he's sweet when you get to know him, and he'd do anything for Dalanar." "Are you going to the Summer Meeting this year? I hope so, at least for the Matrimonial. Ayla and I are going to be mated." This time he gave Ayla a squeeze.  "I don't know," Joplaya said, looking at the ground. Then she looked at him. "I always knew you would never mate that Marona woman who was waiting for you the year you left, but I didn't think you'd bring a woman back with you." Jondalar flushed at the mention of the woman he had promised to mate and left behind, and he didn't notice Ayla stiffen as Joplaya hurried toward a man just coming out of the cave.  "Jondalar! That man!" He caught the startled tone in her voice and turned to look at her. She was ashen.  "What's wrong, Ayla?"  "He looks like Durc! Or maybe the way my son will look when he grows up. Jondalar, that man is part Clan!" Jondalar looked closer. It was true. The man Joplaya was urging toward them had the look of the Clan. But as they approached. Ay la noticed one striking difference between this man and the men of the Clan she knew. He was almost as tall as she.  When he neared, she made a motion with her hand. It was subtle, hardly noticeable to anyone else, but the man's large brown eyes opened wide with surprise.  "Where did you learn that?" he asked, making the same gesture. His voice was deep, but clear and distinct. He had no problem speaking; a sure sign he was a mixture.  "I was raised by a clan. They found me when I was a little girl. I don't remember any family before that." "A clan raised you? They cursed my mother because she gave birth to me," he said bitterly. "What clan would raise you?" "I didn't think her accent was Mamutoi," Jerika interjected. Several people were standing around them.  Jondalar took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. He had known from the beginning Ayla's background would come out sooner or later. "When I met her, she couldn't even talk, Jerika, at least not with words. But she saved my life after I was attacked by a cave lion.  She was adopted by the Mamutoi into the Mammoth Hearth because she is so skilled in healing." "She is Mamut? One Who Serves the Mother? Where is her mark?  I don't see any tattoo on her cheek," Jerika said.  "Ayla learned to heal from the woman who raised her, a medicine woman of the people she calls Clan--natheads--but she's as good as any zeiandoni. The Mamut was only starting to train her to Serve the Mother before we left; she was never initiated. That's why she has no mark," Jondalar explained.  "I knew she was zeiandoni. She has to be to control animals like that, but how could she learn healing from a flathead woman?" Dalanar exclaimed. "Before I met Echozar, I thought they were little more than animals. I understand from him that they can talk, in a way, and now you say they have healers. You should have told me, Echozar." "How would I know? I'm not a. flathead!" Echozar spat the word out.  "I only knew my mother, and Andovan." Ayla was surprised at the venom in his voice. "You said your mother was cursed? And yet she survived to raise you? She must have been a remarkable woman." Echozar looked directly into the gray-blue eyes of the tall blond woman. There was no hesitation, no drawing back to avoid staring at him. He felt strangely drawn to this woman he had never seen before, comfortable with her.  "She didn't talk about it much," Echozar said. "She was attacked by some men, who killed her mate when he tried to protect her. He was the brother of the leader of her clan, and she was blamed for his death.  The leader said she brought bad luck. But later, when she learned she was expecting a child, he took her as a second woman. When I was born, he said it proved she was a bad-luck woman. She had not only killed her mate, she gave birth to a deformed baby. Then he cursed her, a death curse." He was talking more openly to this woman than he normally did, and he was surprised at himself.  "I'm not sure what that means--a death curse," Echozar continued.  "She only told me once, and then she couldn't finish. She said everyone turned away from her, as though they could not see her. They said she was dead, and even though she tried to make them look at her, it was like she wasn't there, like she was dead. It must have been terrible." "It was," Ay la said softly. "It's hard to go on living if you don't exist to the ones you love." Her eyes misted with memory.  "My mother took me and left them to go and die, like she was supposed to, but Andovan found her. He was old even then, and living alone. He never did tell me why he left his Cave, it was something about a cruel leader..." "Andovan..." Ayla interrupted. "Was he S'Armunai?" "Yes, I think so," Echozar said. "He didn't talk about his people much." "We know about their cruel leader," Jondalar said, grimly.  "Andovan took care of us," Echozar continued. "He taught me to hunt. He learned to speak the sign language of the Clan from my mother, but she never could say more than a few words. I learned both, though it surprised her that I could make his word sounds.  Andovan died a few years ago, and with him my mother's will to live.  The death curse finally took her." "What did you do then?" Jondalar asked.  "I lived alone." "That is not easy," Ayla said.  "No, it's not easy. I tried to find someone to live with. No clan would let me near them. They threw stones at me and said I was deformed and unlucky. No Cave would have anything to do with me, either. They said I was an abomination of mixed spirits, half-man and half-animal. After a while I got tired of trying. I didn't want to be alone any more. One day I jumped off a cliff into the river. The next  thing I knew, Dalanar was looking at me. He took me to his Cave.  Now I am Echozar of the Lanzadonii," he finished proudly, glancing at the tall man he idolized.  Ayla thought of her son, grateful he had been accepted as a baby, and grateful there were people who loved him and wanted him when she had to leave him behind.  "Echozar, don't hate your mother's people," she said. "It is not that they are bad, they are just so ancient that it's hard for them to change.  Their traditions go back so far, and they don't understand new ways." "And they are people," Jondalar said to Dalanar. "That's one thing I've learned on this Journey. We met a couple just before we started over the glacier--that's another story--but they're planning meetings about the problems they've been having with some of us, especially some young Losadunai men. Someone has even approached them about trading." "Flatheads having meetings? Trading? This world is changing faster than I can understand," Dalanar said. "Until I met Echozar, I wouldn't have believed it." "People may call them flatheads, and animals, but you know your mother was a brave woman, Echozar," Ayla said, then held out her hands to him. "I know how it feels to have no people. Now I am Ayla of the Mamutoi. Will you welcome me, Echozar of the Lanzadonii?" He took her hands and she felt them tremble. "You are welcome here, Ayla of the Mamutoi," he said.  Jondalar stepped forward with his hands outstretched. "I greet you, Echozar of the Lanzadonii," he said.  "I welcome you, Jondalar of the Zeiandonii," Echozar said, "but you don't need to be welcomed here. I've heard about the son of Dalanar's hearth. There's no doubt you were born of his spirit. You are much like him." Jondalar grinned. "Everyone says so, but don't you think his nose is a little bigger than mine?" "I don't. I think yours is bigger than mine," Dalanar laughed, clapping the younger man's shoulder. "Come inside. The food is getting cold." Ayla lingered a moment to talk to Echozar, and when she turned to go in, Joplaya detained her.  "I want to talk to Ayla, Echozar, but don't go in yet. I want to talk to you, too," she said. He walked away quickly to leave the two women alone, but not before Ayla saw the adoration in his eyes when he looked at Joplaya.  "Ayla, I..." Joplaya began. "I... think I know why Jondalar loves you. I want to say... I want to wish you both happiness."  Ayla studied the dark-haired woman. She sensed a change in her, a drawing in, a feeling of grim finality. Suddenly Ayla knew why she had been so uneasy about the woman.  "Thank you, Joplaya. I love him very much; it would be hard to live without him. It would leave me with a great emptiness inside that would be very hard to bear." "Yes, very hard to bear," Joplaya said, closing her eyes for a moment.    "Aren't you going to come in and eat?" Jondalar said, coming back out of the cave.  "You go ahead, Ayla. There's something I have to do first."    E ' chozar glanced at the large piece of obsidian, then looked away. The ripples in the shiny black glass distorted his reflection, but nothing could change it, and he didn't want to see himself today. He was dressed in a deerskin tunic, fringed with tufts of fur and decorated with beads made of hollow bird bones, dyed quills, and sharp animal teeth. He had never owned anything so fine. Joplaya had made it for him, for the ceremony that officially adopted him into the First Cave of the Lanzadonii.  As he walked into the main area of the cave, he felt the soft leather, smoothing it with reverence knowing her hands had made it. It almost hurt just to think about her. He had loved her from the first. It was she who had talked to him, listened to him, tried to draw him out. He would never have faced all those Zeiandonii at the Summer Meeting that year if it hadn't been for her, and when he saw how the men nocked around her, he wanted to die. It had taken months to work up the courage to ask her: How could anyone who looked like him dare to dream of a woman like her? When she didn't refuse, he nourished his hope. But she had put off giving him an answer for so long, he was sure it was her way of saying no.  Then, on the day Ayla and Jondalar arrived, when she asked him if he still wanted her, he couldn't believe it. Wanted her! He had never wanted anything so much in his life. He waited for a time when he could talk to Dalanar alone. But the visitors were always with him. He didn't want to bother them. And he was afraid to ask. Only the thought of losing his one chance for more happiness than he ever dreamed possible gave him the courage.  Then Dalanar said she was Jerika's daughter and he'd have to talk it over with her, but all he had asked was did Joplaya agree, and did he love her. Did he love her? Did he love her? 0 Mother, did he love her!  Echozar took his place among the people waiting expectantly, and he felt his heart beat faster when he saw Dalanar get up and walk toward a hearth in the middle of the cave. A small wood sculpture of a well-rounded female was stuck in the ground in front of the hearth.  The ample breasts, full stomach, and broad buttocks of the donii were  accurately portrayed, but the head was little more than a knob with no features and the arms and legs were only suggested. Dalanar stood beside the hearth and faced the assembled group.  "First I want to announce that we are going to the Zeiandonii Summer Meeting again this year," Dalanar began, "and we invite any who want to join us to come. It's a long trip for us, but I hope to persuade one of the younger zeiandoni to return and make a home with us. We have no lanzadoni, and we need One Who Serves the Mother. We are growing, soon there will be a Second Cave, and someday the Lanza- donii will have their own Summer Meetings.  "There is another reason for going. Not only will the mating of Jondalar and Ay la be sanctified at the Matrimonial, we will have another reason to celebrate it this year, too." Dalanar picked up the wooden representation of the Great Earth Mother and nodded. Echozar was nervous, even though he knew this was only an announcement ceremony and much more casual than the elaborate Matrimonial would be, with its purifying rituals and taboos.  When they both stood before him, Dalanar began.  "Echozar, Son of Woman blessed of Doni, of the First Cave of the Lanzadonii, you have asked Joplaya, Daughter ofjerika mated to Dalanar, to be your mate. This is true?" "It is true," Echozar said in a voice so weak it could hardly be heard.  "Joplaya, Daughter ofjerika mated to Dalanar..." The words were not the same, but the meaning was, and Ayla shook with sobs as she recalled a similar ceremony when she stood beside a dusky man who looked at her the way Echozar looked at Joplaya.  "Ayla, don't cry, this is a happy occasion," Jondalar said, holding her tenderly.  She could hardly speak; she knew how it felt to stand beside the wrong man. But there was no hope for Joplaya, not even dreams that someday the man she loved would flout custom for her. He didn't even know she loved him, and she couldn't speak of it. He was a cousin, a close-cousin, more sibling than cousin, an unmatable man--and he loved another. Ayla felt Joplaya's pain as her own as she sobbed beside the man they both loved.  "I was thinking of the time I stood beside Ranee like that," she finally said.  Jondalar remembered only too well. He felt a constriction in his chest, a pain in his throat, and he held her fiercely. "Hey, woman, you're going to have me crying soon." He glanced at Jerika, who sat with stiff dignity while tears rolled down her face. "Why do women always cry at these things?" he said.  Jerika looked at Jondalar with an unfathomable expression, then at  Ay la sobbing quietly in his arms. "It's time she mated, time she put away impossible dreams. We can't all have the perfect man," she whispered softly, then turned back to the ceremony.  "... Does the First Cave of the Lanzadonii accept this mating?" Dalanar asked, looking up.  "We accept," they all replied in unison.  "Echozar, Joplaya, you have promised to mate. May Doni, the Great Earth Mother, bless your mating," the leader concluded, touching the wooden carving to the top of Echozar's head and Joplaya's stomach.  He put the donii back in front of the hearth, pushing the peglike legs into the ground so it would stand unsupported.  The couple turned to face the assembled Cave, then began to walk slowly around the central hearth. In the solemn silence, the ineffable air of melancholy surrounding the compellingly beautiful woman added a quality that made her seem even more exquisitely lovely.  The man beside her was a fraction shorter. His large beaky nose protruded beyond a heavy chinless jaw that jutted forward. His overhanging brow ridges, joined at the center, were accented by thick, unruly eyebrows that crossed his forehead in a single hairy line. His arms were heavily muscled, and his huge barrel chest and long body were supported by short, hairy, bowed legs. Those were the features that marked him as Clan. But he could not be called flathead. Unlike them, he lacked the low sloping forehead that swept back into a large long head--the squashed-flat look that prompted the name. Instead, Echozar's forehead rose as straight and high above his bony brow ridges as that of any other member of the Cave.  But Echozar was incredibly ugly. The antithesis of the woman beside him. Only his eyes belied the comparison, but they overwhelmed.  His large, liquid, brown eyes were so full of tender adoration for the woman he loved, they even overwhelmed the unspeakable sadness that hung in the atmosphere through which Joplaya moved.  But not even that evidence of Echozar's love could overcome the pain Ayla felt for Joplaya. She buried her head in Jondalar's chest because it hurt too much to look, though she fought to overcome the desolation of her empathy.  When the couple completed the third circuit, the silence was broken as people got up to offer good wishes. Ayla held back, trying to compose herself. Finally, urged by Jondalar, they went to extend their wishes of happiness.  "Joplaya, I'm so glad you'll be celebrating your Matrimonial with us," Jondalar said, giving her a hug. She clung to him. He was surprised at the intensity of her embrace. He had the disconcerting feeling she was saying goodbye, as though she would never see him again.  "I don't have to wish you happiness, Echozar," Ayla said. "I will wish instead that you are always as happy as you are now." "With Joplaya, how can it be any other way?" he said. Spontaneously, she hugged him. He wasn't ugly to her, he had a comfortable, familiar look. It took him a moment to respond; beautiful women didn't hug him often, and he felt a warm affection for the golden-haired woman.  Then she turned to Joplaya. As she looked into eyes as green as Jondalar's were blue, the words she meant to say stuck in her throat.  With an aching cry she reached for Joplaya, overcome by her hopeless acceptance. Joplaya held her, patting her back as though it were Ayla who needed consolation.  "It's all right, Ayla," Joplaya said, in a voice that sounded hollow, empty. Her eyes were dry. "What else could I do? I'll never find a man who loves me as much as Echozar does. I've known for a long time I would mate him. There just wasn't any reason to wait any more." Ayla stood back, fighting to control tears she shed for the woman who could not, and she saw Echozar move closer. He put a tentative arm around Joplaya's waist, still not quite able to believe it. He was afraid he would wake up and find it was all a dream. He didn't know he had only the shell of the woman he loved. It didn't matter. The shell was enough.    "Well, no. I didn't see it with my own eyes," Hochaman said, "and I can't say that I believed it, then. But if you can ride horses and teach a wolf to follow you around, then why couldn't someone ride the back of a mammoth?" "Where did you say this happened?" Dalanar asked.  "It was not long after we started out, far to the east. It must have been a four-toed mammoth," Hochaman said.  "A four-toed mammoth? I've never heard of such a thing," Jondalar said, "not even from the Mamutoi." "They are not the only ones who hunt mammoths, you know," Hochaman said, "and they don't live far enough to the east. Believe me, they are close neighbors, in comparison. When you really go east, and get close to the Endless Sea, mammoths have four toes on their hind feet. They tend to be darker, too. A lot of them are almost black." "Well, if Ayla could ride on the back of a cave lion, I don't doubt that someone could learn to ride a mammoth. What do you think?" Jondalar asked, looking at Ayla.  "If you got one young enough," she said. "I think if you raised almost any animal around people from the time it was a baby, you could teach it something. At least not to be afraid of people. Mam-  moths are smart; they could learn a lot. We watched the way they broke up ice for water. Many other animals used it, too." "They can smell it from a long distance away, too," Hochaman said.  "It's a lot drier in the east, and the people there always say, 'If you run out of water, look for a mammoth.' They can go for quite a while without it, if they have to, but eventually they will lead you to it." "That's good to know," Echozar said.  "Yes, especially if you travel much,"Joplaya said.  "I don't plan to travel much," he said.  "But you will be coming to the Zeiandonii Summer Meeting," Jon- dalar said.  "For our Matrimonial, of course," Echozar said. "And I'd like to see you again." He smiled tentatively. "It would be nice if you and Ayla lived here." "Yes. I hope you will both consider our offer," Dalanar said. "You know this is always your home, Jondalar, and we don't have a healer, except for Jerika, who is not really trained. We need a lanzadoni and we both think Ayla would be perfect. You could visit with your mother, and return with us after the Summer Meeting." "Believe me, we appreciate your offer, Dalanar," Jondalar said, "and we will consider it." Ayla glanced at Joplaya. She had withdrawn, closed in on herself.  She liked the woman, but they talked mostly of superficial things. Ayla could not overcome her sorrow at Joplaya's plight--she had come too close to a similar circumstance--and her own happiness was a constant reminder of Joplaya's pain. As much as she had grown to like everyone, she was glad they would be leaving in the morning.  She would particularly miss Jerika and Dalanar, and listening to their heated "discussions." The woman was tiny; when Dalanar held his arm out, she could walk under it with room to spare, but she had an indomitable will. She was as much a leader of the Cave as he was and argued vociferously when her opinion differed from his. Dalanar listened to her seriously, but by no means did he always yield. The welfare of his people was his main concern, and he often took the question at issue to them, but he made most decisions himself as matter-of-factly as any natural leader. He never made demands, he simply commanded respect.  After the first few times, when she misunderstood, Ayla loved to listen to them argue, hardly bothering to hide a smile at the sight of the child-size woman in heated debate with the giant of a man. What amazed her most was the way they could interrupt a violent discussion with a tender word of affection, or to talk of something else, just as  though they had not been at each other's throats, and then resume the verbal combat as though they were the bitterest of enemies. Once the arguments were resolved, they were promptly forgotten. But they seemed to enjoy the intellectual duels, and for all their difference in size, it was a battle of equals. They not only loved each other, they had great respect for each other.    The weather was warming and spring was in full bloom when Ayla and Jondalar started out again. Dalanar passed on good wishes to the Ninth Cave of the Zeiandonii, and he reminded them again of his offer.  They had both felt welcome, but Ay la's sensitivity to Joplaya made it difficult for her to think about living with the Lanzadonii. It would be too hard on both of them, but it was not something she could explain to Jondalar.  He did sense a peculiar strain in the relationship between the two women, though they seemed to like each other. Joplaya behaved differently toward him, too. She was more distant, didn't joke and tease the way she always had. But he had been surprised at the vehemence of her last embrace. Tears had filled her eyes. He had reminded her that he was not going on a long Journey, he had just come back, and they would see each other soon, at the Summer Meeting.  He had been relieved that they had both been so warmly welcomed, and he would definitely consider Dalanar's offer, particularly if the Zeiandonii were not as accepting of Ayla. It was good to know they would have a place, but in his heart, as much as he loved Dalanar and the Lanzadonii, the Zeiandonii were his people. If possible, that was where he wanted to live with Ayla.  When they finally left, Ayla felt as though a burden had lifted. In spite of the rains, she was happy to feel the weather warming, and on sunny days it was too beautiful to be sad for long. She was a woman in love traveling with her man, and going to meet his people, going to her new home. She could not help feeling ambivalent about it, though, full of hope and worry.  It was country Jondalar knew, and he greeted every familiar landmark with excitement, and often a comment or story about it. They rode through a pass between two mountain ridges, then picked up a river that twisted and turned in the right general direction. They left it at its source, and crossed several large rivers flowing from north to south across a low valley, then climbed a large massif overtopped with volcanoes, one still smoking, others quiescent. Crossing over a plateau, near the source of a river, they passed by some hot springs.  "I'm sure this is the beginning of the river that flows right in front  of the Ninth Cave," Jondalar said, full of enthusiasm. "We're almost there, Ayla! We can be home by nightfall." "Are these the hot healing waters you told me about?" Ayla asked.  "Yes. We call them Doni's Healing Waters," he said.  "Let's stay here tonight," she said.  "But we're almost there," Jondalar said, "almost at the end of our Journey, and I've been away for so long." "That's why I want to spend the night here. It's the end of our Journey. I want to bathe in the hot water, and I want to spend one last night alone with just you, before we meet all your kin." Jondalar looked at her and smiled. "You're right. After all this time, what's one more night? And it is the last time we'll be alone together for a long time. Besides"--his smile warmed--"I like being with you around hot springs." They put up their tent at a site that had obviously been used before.  Ayla thought the horses seemed agitated when they were let free to graze on the fresh grass of the plateau, but she had seen some young coltsfoot and sorrel leaves. When she went to pick them, she saw some spring mushrooms and then crab apple blossoms and elder shoots. She returned to their campsite holding the front of her tunic out like a basket, full of fresh greens and other delicacies.  "I think you are planning a feast," Jondalar said.  "It's not a bad idea. I saw a nest that I want to go back and check for eggs," Ayla said.  "Then what do you think of this?" he said, holding up a trout. Ayla smiled with delight. "I thought I saw it in the stream, sharpened a green stick into a gorge, and dug up a worm to thread around it. This fish bit so fast, it was almost like it was waiting for me." "Definitely the makings for a feast!" "But it can wait, can't it?" Jondalar said. "I think I'd rather see a hot bath right now." His blue eyes filled with his thoughts of her and aroused her response.  "A wonderful idea," she said, emptying her tunic beside the firepit, then walking into his arms.    They sat side by side, a little back from the fire, feeling replete, satisfied, and entirely relaxed, watching sparks dance an arabesque and disappear into the night. Wolf was dozing nearby. Suddenly he raised his head and cocked his ears toward the dark plateau. They heard a loud, full-throated neigh, but it was not familiar. Then the mare squealed, and Racer whinnied.  "There's a strange horse in the field," Ayla said, jumping up. It was a moonless night and hard to see.  "You'll never find your way out there tonight. Let me try to find something to make a torch." Whinney squealed again, the strange horse neighed, and they heard hoofbeats racing off into the night.  "That does it," Jondalar said. "It's too late tonight. I think she's gone. A horse has captured her again." "This time, I think she left because she wanted to. I thought she seemed nervous; I should have paid closer attention," Ayla said. "It's her season, Jondalar. I'm sure that was a stallion, and I think Racer went with them. He's too young, yet, but I'm sure other mares are in season, too, and he would be drawn to them." "It's too dark to look for them now, but I do know this region. We can track them in the morning." "The last time, I took her out, and the brown stallion came for her.  She came back to me on her own, and later, she had Racer. I think she's out starting a baby again," Ayla said, sitting down by the fire.  She looked at Jondalar and grinned. "It seems right, both of us pregnant at the same time." It took a moment for her statement to register. "Both of you.  pregnant... at the same time? Ayla! Are you saying you are pregnant?  Are you going to have a baby?" "Yes," she said, nodding. "I am going to have your baby, Jondalar." "My baby? You're going to have my baby? Ayla! Ayla." He picked her up, spun her around, and then kissed her. "Are you sure? I mean, are you sure you are going to have a baby? The spirit could have come from one of the men at Dalanar's Cave, or even the Losadunai.  That's all right, if that's what the Mother wants." "I passed my moon time without bleeding, and I feel pregnant. I've even been getting a little sick in the morning. Not bad, though. I think we started it when we got down off the glacier," Ayla said. "And it is your baby, Jondalar, I'm sure of it. It can't be anyone else's. Started with your essence. The essence of your manhood." "My baby?" he said, a look of soft wonder in his eyes. He put his hand on her stomach. "You have my baby in there? I've wanted that so much," he said, looking away and blinking his eyes. "Do you know, I even asked the Mother for it." "Didn't you tell me the Mother always gives you what you ask for, Jondalar?" She smiled with his happiness, and her own. "Tell me, did you ask for a boy or a girl?" "Just a baby, Ayla. It doesn't matter which." "Then you won't mind if I hope for a girl this time?" He shook his head. "Just your baby, and maybe, mine."  "The trouble with tracking horses on foot is that they can travel so much faster than we can," Ayla said.  "But I think I know where they might be going," Jondalar said, "and I know a shorter way, up over the top of that ridge." "What if they aren't where you think?" "Then we'll have to come back and pick up their trail again, but their tracks are heading in the right direction," he said. "Don't worry, Ayla. We'll find them." "We have to, Jondalar. We've been through too much. I can't let her go back to a herd now." Jondalar led the way to a sheltered field where he had often seen horses before. They found many horses there. It did not take Ayla long to identify her friend. They clambered down to the edge of the grassy bottomland, although Jondalar watched Ayla closely, a little worried that she might be doing more than she should. She whistled the familiar call.  Whinney lifted her head and galloped toward the woman, followed by a large pale stallion and a young brown one. The pale stallion detoured to challenge the young one, who quickly backed away. Although he was excited by the presence of females in heat, he was not ready to challenge the experienced herd stallion for his own dam.  Jondalar ran toward Racer, spear-thrower in hand, ready to protect him from the powerful dominant animal, but the young stallion's own actions had protected him. The pale horse veered back toward the receptive mare.  Ayla was standing with her arms around Whinney's neck when the stallion arrived, reared, and displayed his full potential. Whinney backed away from the woman and answered. Jondalar approached, leading Racer with a sturdy rope attached to his halter, looking worried.    "You can try putting her halter on her," Jondalar said.  "No. We'll have to camp here tonight. She's not ready to come yet.  They are making a baby, and Whinney wants one. I want to let her," Ayla said.  Jondalar shrugged his acquiescence. "Why not? There's no hurry.  We can camp here for a while." He watched Racer strain toward the herd. "He wants to join the others, too. Do you think it would be safe to let him go?" "I don't think they'll go anyplace. This is a big field, and if they do go away, we can climb up and see where they're heading. It might be good for him to be with other horses for a while. Maybe he can learn from them," Ayla said.  "I think you're right," he said, slipping off the halter, and watching Racer gallop down the field. "I wonder if Racer will ever be a herd stallion? And share Pleasures with all of the females." And, maybe, start young horses growing inside them, he thought.  "We might as well find a place to make camp and make ourselves comfortable," Ayla said. "And think about hunting something to eat.  There may be willow grouse in those trees by that stream." "Too bad there are no hot springs here," Jondalar said. "It's amazing how relaxing a hot bath is." Ayla looked down from a great height at an unending expanse of water. In the opposite direction, the broad grassy plains stretched out as far as she could see. Nearby was a familiar mountain meadow, with a small cave in a rock wall at the edge. Hazelnut brush grew against the wall, hiding the entrance.  She was afraid. It was snowing outside the cave, blocking the entrance, but when she pushed the brush aside and stepped out, it was spring. Flowers were blooming and birds singing. New life was everywhere. The lusty cry of a newborn came from the cave.  She was following someone down the mountain, carrying a baby on her hip with the help of a carrying cloak. He limped and walked with a staff and carried something in a cloak on his back that bulged out. It was Creb, and he was protecting her newborn. They walked, it seemed forever, but traveled a great distance across mountains and vast plains, until they came to a valley with a grassy sheltered field. Horses went there frequently.  Creb stopped, took off his bulging cloak and laid it on the ground. She thought she saw the white of bone inside, but a young brown horse stepped away from the cloak, and ran to a dun yellow mare. She whistled to the horse, but she galloped away with a pale stallion.  Creb turned and beckoned to her, but she couldn't quite understand his sign.  It was an everyday language she didn't know. He made a new signal. "Come, we can be there before dark." She was in a long tunnel deep in a cave. Ahead a light flickered. It was an opening to the outside. She was walking up a steep path along a wall of creamy white rock, following a man taking long, eager strides. She knew the place, and she hurried to catch up.  "Wait! Wait for me. I'm coming," she called out.    "Ayla! Ayla!" Jondalar was shaking her. "Were you having a bad dream?" "A strange dream, but not a bad dream," she said. She got up, felt a wave of nausea, and lay back down, hoping it would go away.  Jondalar flapped the leather ground cloth at the pale stallion, and Wolf yipped and harried him, while Ay la slipped a halter over Whin- ney's head. She had only a small pack. Racer, tied securely to a tree, carried most of the burden.  Ayla leaped to the mare's back and urged her to a gallop, guiding her along the edge of the long field. The stallion chased them, but he slowed as they gained distance from the rest of the mares. Finally he pulled to a halt, reared, and neighed, calling to Whinney. He reared again and raced back toward the herd. Several stallions had already tried to take advantage of his absence. He closed in and reared again, screaming a challenge.  Ayla on Whinney kept going, but she slowed down from the fast gallop. When she heard hoofbeats behind, she stopped and waited for Jondalar and Racer, with Wolf on their heels.  "If we hurry, we can be there before dark," Jondalar said.  Ayla and Whinney fell in beside them. She had the strange feeling that she had done this before.  They rode at a comfortable pace. "I think we are both going to have babies, now," Ayla said, "our second ones, and we both had sons before. I think that's good. We can share this time together." "You'll have many people to share your pregnancy with," Jondalar said.  "I'm sure you are right, but it will be nice to share it with Whinney, too, since we both got pregnant on this Journey." They rode in silence for a while. "She's a lot younger than I am, though. I'm old to be having a baby." "You're not so old, Ayla. I'm the old man." "I am nineteen years this spring. That's old to have a baby." "I am much older. I am past twenty and three years, by now. That is old for a man to be settling down to his own hearth for the first time.  Do you realize I've been gone five years? I wonder if anyone will even remember me," Jondalar said.  "Of course they will remember you. Dalanar didn't have any trouble, and neither did Joplaya," Ayla said. Everyone will know him, she thought, but no one will know me.  "Look! See that rock over there? Just beyond the turn in the river?  That's where I made my first kill!" Jondalar said, urging Racer on a little faster. "It was a big deer. I don't know what I was most afraid of --those big antlers, or missing and going home empty-handed." Ayla smiled, pleased at his remembrances, but there was nothing for her to remember. She would be a stranger again. They would all stare at her, and they would ask about her strange accent and where she came from.  "We had a Summer Meeting here once,"Jondalar said. "There were hearths set up all over this place. It was my first after I became a man.  Oh, how I strutted, trying to act so old, but so afraid that no young woman would invite me to her First Rites. I guess I didn't have to worry. I was invited to three, and that scared me even more!" "There are some people over there, watching us, Jondalar," Ayla said.  "That's the Fourteenth Cave!" he said, and waved. No one waved back. Instead they disappeared under a deep overhang.  "It must be the horses," Ayla said.  He frowned, then shook his head. "They'll get used to them." I hope so, Ayla thought, and me, too. The only thing familiar around here will be Jondalar.  "Ayla! There it is!" Jondalar said. "The Ninth Cave of the Zeian- donii." She looked in the direction he was pointing, and she felt herself blanch.  "It's always easy to find because of that outcrop on top. See, where it looks like a stone is ready to fall? It won't though, unless the whole thing does." Jondalar turned to look at her. "Ayla, are you ill? You're so pale." She stopped. "I've seen that place before, Jondalar!" "How could you? You've never been here before." Suddenly it all came together. It was the cave in my dreams! The one that came from Creb's memories, she thought. Now I know what he was trying to tell me in my dreams.  "I told you my totem meant you for me and sent you to come and get me. He wanted you to take me home, the place where my Cave Lion spirit will be happy. This is it. I have come home, too, Jondalar.  Your home is my home," Ayla said.  He smiled; but before he could answer, they heard a voice shouting his name. "Jondalar! Jondalar!" They looked up along a path to a cliff overhang, and saw a young woman.  "Mother! Come quick," she said. "Jondalar is back. Jondalar is home!" And so am I, Ayla thought.  _ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   Each of the books in this Earth's Children™ series has posed its own unique challenges, but from the beginning, when the sometime novel/six-book outline was first conceived, the fourth book, the "travel book," has been both the most difficult and the most interesting to research and write. The Plains of Passage required some additional travel for the author as well, including a return visit to Czechoslovakia, and trips to Hungary, Austria, and Germany to follow a portion of the Danube (the Great Mother River). But to put the setting into the Ice Age, even more time was needed for library research.  I am again indebted to Dr. Jan Jelinek, Director Emeritus, Anthro- pos Institute, Bmo, Czechoslovakia, for his unfailing kindness, assistance, and astute observations and interpretations of the rich Upper Paleolithic artifacts of the region.  I am also grateful to Dr. Bohuslav Klima, Archeologicky Ustav CSAV, for the wonderful wine tasting in his own cellar from his vineyards near Doini Vestonice, but more for giving so generously of his lifetime of knowledge and information about that most important early site.  I would also like to thank Dr. Jiri Svoboda, Archeologicky Ustav CSAV, for information on his startling new discoveries that add greatly to our knowledge about our Early Modem Human ancestors who lived more than two hundred fifty centuries ago when ice covered a quarter of the globe.  To Dr. Olga Softer, the leading American expert on the Upper Paleolithic people of Central and Eastern Europe, I extend thanks and gratitude beyond measure for keeping me informed about the most recent developments, and supplied with the latest papers, including the results of a new study on the earliest ceramic art in human history.  I want to thank Dr. Milford Wolpoff, University of Michigan, for his insights during our discussion about population distributions on the northern continents during the last Ice Age, when our modem human forebears clustered in concentrations in certain favorable areas and left most of the land, though rich in animal life, without people.  Finding the pieces of the puzzle that were necessary to create this fictional world of the prehistoric past was a challenge; putting them together was another. After studying the material available about glaciers and the environment that surrounded them, I still could not get a completely clear picture of all the northern lands, so that I could move my characters through their world. There were questions, theories at odds with each other--some of which did not seem very well thought out--pieces that did not fit.  Finally, with great relief and growing enthusiasm, I found the one clearly explained and thoughtfully constructed study that brought the Ice Age world into sharp focus. It answered the questions that had risen in my mind, and enabled me to fit in the rest of the pieces from other sources and my own speculations so that I could make a logical setting. I will be eternally grateful to R. Dale Guthrie for his article "Mammals of the Mammoth Steppe as Paleoenvironmental Indicators," pages 307-326, from Paleoecology of Beringia (Ed. by David M.  Hopkins, John V. Matthews, Jr., Charles E. Schweger, and Steven B.  Young, Academic Press, 1982). More than any other single work, that paper helped this book come together as a cohesive, comprehensive, and comprehensible whole.  Since woolly mammoths symbolize the Ice Age, considerable effort was devoted to bringing those prehistoric pachyderms to life. My research included searching out everything I could find on mammoths and, since they were so closely related, modem elephants. Among these sources. Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family by Dr. Cynthia Moss (William Morrow & Co., Inc., 1988), stands out as a definitive work. I am indebted to Dr. Moss for her many years of study and her intelligent and highly readable book.  In addition to research, a writer is concerned about the way her words come together and the quality of the finished work. I am forever grateful to Laurie Stark, Executive Managing Editor of the Crown Publishing Group, who makes sure the finished manuscript becomes the printed pages of a well-made book. She has been responsible for all four books, and, in a changing world, I appreciate the continuity and consistently high quality she has given them.  I am also thankful for Betty A. Prashker, Editor-in-Chief, Vice President, and more important, outstanding editor, who marshals--or mothers--the manuscript I turn in to its finished form.  My thanks go in full measure to Jean V. Naggar; in the Literary Olympics, a world-class, first-place, gold-medal-winning agent!  And finally to Ray Auel, love and appreciation beyond words.  For LENORE, the last to come home, whose namesake appears in these pages, and for MICHAEL, who looks forward with her, and for DUSTIN JOYCE and WENDY, with love.  _The End_
